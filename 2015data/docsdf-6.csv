Beloved wife of William G. Kaelin, Jr., MD, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School Professor, and loving mother to Kathryn Grace and William (Tripp). She was 54 years old. A technically gifted and compassionate breast cancer surgeon at the Dana- Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Carolyn graduated from Smith College and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She earned her master's degree from Harvard School of Public Health. At 34, she became the Founding Director of the Comprehensive Breast Health Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital, then the youngest woman singled out for a job of this caliber at a major Harvard teaching hospital. She quickly established herself as one of the nation's premier breast cancer surgeons. Also active in research, Carolyn focused on how doctors and patients make medical decisions and on quality of life issues for breast cancer survivors, particularly the role of exercise. In 2001, Newsweek featured her as one of 15 Women of the New Century. An avid athlete, Carolyn rode repeatedly in the Pan-Mass Challenge, a 192-mile bicycle ride fundraiser for the Dana- Farber Cancer Institute. Shortly after a training ride in 2003, she noticed early signs of her own breast cancer. After several attempts at breast conservation surgery failed, she had a mastectomy. Nonetheless, while still recovering from surgery, Carolyn rode the PMC with team WOW (Women Oncologists on Wheels). Sadly, a rare complication of breast cancer therapy prevented Carolyn from returning to the clinical practice and patients she so loved. She instead redoubled her patient education and survivorship efforts, with a particular emphasis on the underserved, all while being a devoted mother to her two children. Through many actions, Carolyn vastly improved the lives of women facing breast cancer. A pathfinder with vision and the steel to see it through, she initiated research on the value of rowing in patients with postoperative lymphedema with an assist from Olympian Holly Metcalf, the founder of We Can Row, co-authored two award-winning books, Living Through Breast Cancer and The Breast Cancer Survivor's Fitness Plan, and helped create an innovative, exercise-centered breast cancer recovery program for the YMCA. Intent on using her experiences to help others, she established the Quality of Life Fund at Brigham and Women's Hospital to support breast cancer survivorship projects and launched the successful Knowledge, Strength, and Grace conference series for breast cancer patients and their families. In Aspen, Colorado, Carolyn's adopted second home where she loved to bicycle and hike, she cofounded the Quality of Life Cancer Fund with her dear friend Barbara Berger. Under the stewardship of the Berger family, this fund raises over $100,000 each year to support indigent cancer patients living in Colorado's Roaring Fork Valley. Both a beacon and a powerhouse, Carolyn was empathetic, upbeat, deeply kind, intelligent, and gracious. She received numerous honors, including an Exceptional Women Award from Candy O'Terry and WMJX as well as the Mary Horrigan Connors Award at Brigham and Women's Hospital recognizing her outstanding commitment to women's health. In 2010, Carolyn was diagnosed with brain cancer unrelated to her previous breast cancer. In the course of her treatments, she had two brain surgeries, each requiring extensive rehabilitation so that she could relearn to walk, and she was a trailblazer on several clinical trials testing new medical treatments for brain cancer. Always indomitable, she faced innumerable challenges, yet rose to each one, roaring back from setbacks to spend increasingly precious time with close friends and her family, who meant the world to her. Carolyn is survived by her husband and children, parents Mary and Richard Scerbo of Boston, brother Richard Scerbo of Boston and his wife Ellen Scerbo, and many loving aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, and in-laws. A memorial service will be held at St. Ignatius Church in Chestnut Hill, MA on Friday, August 28th at 4pm. Guests are welcome to wear a touch of pink. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that gifts be made to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston or to Dana Farber Cancer Institute to support brain tumor research under the supervision of Dr. Patrick Wen.

725,,2015-08-04,article,"Paid Notice: Deaths  JONES, HOWARD W.",55cab6b7798810348576cc7d,Classified,"JONES--Howard W.,Jr., MD. We honor the life of Howard W. Jones, Jr., MD, 104, a pioneering medical visionary, dedicated mentor, internationally renowned gynecological surgeon, and the father of in vitro fertilization in the United States. Dr. Jones, along with his wife Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones, helped create America's first ""test-tube"" baby in 1981, transforming reproductive medical science and propelling the field from a dream to reality. Their innovations have enabled nearly 6 million births worldwide through in vitro fertilization. Dr. Jones served on the Board and was Honorary Chairman of the Board of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine until the time of his death. The Foundation funds groundbreaking research and the fellows and doctors trained at the Foundation share their knowledge around the world to serve mankind. Dr. Jones's keen mind, up until the end of his life, astonished his colleagues, friends and family. He continued to stay abreast of reproductive endocrinology, attend lectures and conferences, and ask probing questions during medical meetings. ""One more question,"" he would proclaim in his deep voice. ""Ageless, he never aged,"" said Dr. Alan DeCherney, director of the Program in Reproductive and Adult Endocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Jones was born on December 30, 1910 in Baltimore, Maryland. It was a remarkable coincidence that he was delivered, at home, by his future father-in-law, Dr. King Seegar. His father was a physician and they went on house calls together in a horse and buggy. When Dr. Jones was 13, his father died and his aunt helped raise him. Dr. Jones attended the Friends School in Baltimore and Amherst College, where his professor of English was Robert Frost. Dr. Jones graduated from Amherst cum laude in 1931. Dr. Jones loved to recount how he fell in love with Georgeanna Seegar on February 29th, 1932 at a medical lecture. She later said that the evening changed her life. He assumed it was because it was the night she fell in love with him, too; she insisted it was because he inspired her to apply to medical school and become an endocrinologist. They were rarely apart, sharing one desk and one car. Dr. Jones served in WWII as the chief of a mobile surgical team in the United States Corp Fifth Auxiliary Surgical Group with General George S. Patton. When Dr. Jones was 94, he published a collection of love letters he and his wife wrote each day during the war. Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones died in 2005. In the 1950s, Dr. Jones collaborated on landmark cervical cancer studies and became the recognized expert at Johns Hopkins for genital abnormalities and reconstructions. In 1965, he, and his wife, who was the director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Robert Edwards, collaborated in the lab and succeeded at the first steps of in vitro fertilization. After mandatory retirement from Johns Hopkins, a former classmate, Dr. Mason Andrews, recruited Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones to the Eastern Virginia Medical School. They continued working on in vitro fertilization and had 41 failures before their first success, when Judith Carr gave birth to Elizabeth Carr on December 28, 1981, two days before Dr. Jones's 71st birthday. Over the years, Dr. Jones welcomed former patients who came with their toddlers to celebrate Mother's Day and baby photos adorned his office. Dr. Jones served with great distinction as Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School. He was also Professor Emeritus at Johns Hopkins where he served as Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, acting Chairman of the Department, and Secretary General of the University Program for International Education. Dr. Jones received honorary degrees from the University of Cordoba, Old Dominion University, Amherst College, the University of Madrid, and Eastern Virginia Medical School. He is the recipient of the Medal of the College of France and the Distinguished Service Award of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He launched the first ethics committee dealing with fertility as part of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. At the age of 103, he wrote In Vitro Fertilization Comes to America: Memoir of a Medical Breakthrough, retelling his amazing career. A year earlier, he published Personhood Revisited: Reproductive Technology, Bioethics, Religion and the Law, an exploration into the legal and ethical implications of fertility treatments and a perspective on pending legislation seeking to define the union of a sperm and egg as a person. Dr. Jones published a dozen books and hundreds of scientific journal articles. Dr. Jones is survived by three children, seven grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren. His son, Howard W. Jones III, MD, is Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A daughter, Georgeanna Jones Klingensmith, MD, is the Past Director of Pediatric Diabetes at the Barbara Davis Diabetes Center at the University of Colorado, and his son Lawrence Massey Jones is a Denver-based financial advisor. At a 100th birthday celebration Dr. Jones quoted his professor at Amherst in describing himself: ""Two Roads diverged in a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.""-- Robert Frost. The Board and staff of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine, millions of parents and children, and those who had the good fortune to be touched by his innovative genius and kind spirit honor the man who took the road less traveled.

Jones, Jr., MD, 104, a pioneering medical visionary, dedicated mentor, internationally renowned gynecological surgeon, and the father of in vitro fertilization in the United States. Dr. Jones, along with his wife Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones, helped create America's first ""test-tube"" baby in 1981, transforming reproductive medical science and propelling the field from a dream to reality. Their innovations have enabled nearly 6 million births worldwide through in vitro fertilization. Dr. Jones served on the Board and was Honorary Chairman of the Board of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine until the time of his death. The Foundation funds groundbreaking research and the fellows and doctors trained at the Foundation share their knowledge around the world to serve mankind. Dr. Jones's keen mind, up until the end of his life, astonished his colleagues, friends and family. He continued to stay abreast of reproductive endocrinology, attend lectures and conferences, and ask probing questions during medical meetings. ""One more question,"" he would proclaim in his deep voice. ""Ageless, he never aged,"" said Dr. Alan DeCherney, director of the Program in Reproductive and Adult Endocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Jones was born on December 30, 1910 in Baltimore, Maryland. It was a remarkable coincidence that he was delivered, at home, by his future father-in-law, Dr. King Seegar. His father was a physician and they went on house calls together in a horse and buggy. When Dr. Jones was 13, his father died and his aunt helped raise him. Dr. Jones attended the Friends School in Baltimore and Amherst College, where his professor of English was Robert Frost. Dr. Jones graduated from Amherst cum laude in 1931. Dr. Jones loved to recount how he fell in love with Georgeanna Seegar on February 29th, 1932 at a medical lecture. She later said that the evening changed her life. He assumed it was because it was the night she fell in love with him, too; she insisted it was because he inspired her to apply to medical school and become an endocrinologist. They were rarely apart, sharing one desk and one car. Dr. Jones served in WWII as the chief of a mobile surgical team in the United States Corp Fifth Auxiliary Surgical Group with General George S. Patton. When Dr. Jones was 94, he published a collection of love letters he and his wife wrote each day during the war. Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones died in 2005. In the 1950s, Dr. Jones collaborated on landmark cervical cancer studies and became the recognized expert at Johns Hopkins for genital abnormalities and reconstructions. In 1965, he, and his wife, who was the director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Robert Edwards, collaborated in the lab and succeeded at the first steps of in vitro fertilization. After mandatory retirement from Johns Hopkins, a former classmate, Dr. Mason Andrews, recruited Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones to the Eastern Virginia Medical School. They continued working on in vitro fertilization and had 41 failures before their first success, when Judith Carr gave birth to Elizabeth Carr on December 28, 1981, two days before Dr. Jones's 71st birthday. Over the years, Dr. Jones welcomed former patients who came with their toddlers to celebrate Mother's Day and baby photos adorned his office. Dr. Jones served with great distinction as Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School. He was also Professor Emeritus at Johns Hopkins where he served as Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, acting Chairman of the Department, and Secretary General of the University Program for International Education. Dr. Jones received honorary degrees from the University of Cordoba, Old Dominion University, Amherst College, the University of Madrid, and Eastern Virginia Medical School. He is the recipient of the Medal of the College of France and the Distinguished Service Award of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He launched the first ethics committee dealing with fertility as part of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. At the age of 103, he wrote In Vitro Fertilization Comes to America: Memoir of a Medical Breakthrough, retelling his amazing career. A year earlier, he published Personhood Revisited: Reproductive Technology, Bioethics, Religion and the Law, an exploration into the legal and ethical implications of fertility treatments and a perspective on pending legislation seeking to define the union of a sperm and egg as a person. Dr. Jones published a dozen books and hundreds of scientific journal articles. Dr. Jones is survived by three children, seven grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren. His son, Howard W. Jones III, MD, is Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A daughter, Georgeanna Jones Klingensmith, MD, is the Past Director of Pediatric Diabetes at the Barbara Davis Diabetes Center at the University of Colorado, and his son Lawrence Massey Jones is a Denver-based financial advisor. At a 100th birthday celebration Dr. Jones quoted his professor at Amherst in describing himself: ""Two Roads diverged in a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.""-- Robert Frost. The Board and staff of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine, millions of parents and children, and those who had the good fortune to be touched by his innovative genius and kind spirit honor the man who took the road less traveled.

827,,2015-08-09,article,"Paid Notice: Deaths  JONES, HOWARD W.",55d14e5c79881047a7501a5f,Classified,"JONES--Howard W.,Jr., MD. We honor the life of Howard W. Jones, Jr., MD, 104, a pioneering medical visionary, dedicated mentor, internationally renowned gynecological surgeon, and the father of in vitro fertilization in the United States. Dr. Jones, along with his wife Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones, helped create America's first ""test-tube"" baby in 1981, transforming reproductive medical science and propelling the field from a dream to reality. Their innovations have enabled nearly 6 million births worldwide through in vitro fertilization. Dr. Jones served on the Board and was Honorary Chairman of the Board of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine until the time of his death. The Foundation funds groundbreaking research and the fellows and doctors trained at the Foundation share their knowledge around the world to serve mankind. Dr. Jones's keen mind, up until the end of his life, astonished his colleagues, friends and family. He continued to stay abreast of reproductive endocrinology, attend lectures and conferences, and ask probing questions during medical meetings. ""One more question,"" he would proclaim in his deep voice. ""Ageless, he never aged,"" said Dr. Alan DeCherney, director of the Program in Reproductive and Adult Endocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Jones was born on December 30, 1910 in Baltimore, Maryland. It was a remarkable coincidence that he was delivered, at home, by his future father-in-law, Dr. King Seegar. His father was a physician and they went on house calls together in a horse and buggy. When Dr. Jones was 13, his father died and his aunt helped raise him. Dr. Jones attended the Friends School in Baltimore and Amherst College, where his professor of English was Robert Frost. Dr. Jones graduated from Amherst cum laude in 1931. Dr. Jones loved to recount how he fell in love with Georgeanna Seegar on February 29th, 1932 at a medical lecture. She later said that the evening changed her life. He assumed it was because it was the night she fell in love with him, too; she insisted it was because he inspired her to apply to medical school and become an endocrinologist. They were rarely apart, sharing one desk and one car. Dr. Jones served in WWII as the chief of a mobile surgical team in the United States Corp Fifth Auxiliary Surgical Group with General George S. Patton. When Dr. Jones was 94, he published a collection of love letters he and his wife wrote each day during the war. Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones died in 2005. In the 1950s, Dr. Jones collaborated on landmark cervical cancer studies and became the recognized expert at Johns Hopkins for genital abnormalities and reconstructions. In 1965, he, and his wife, who was the director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Robert Edwards, collaborated in the lab and succeeded at the first steps of in vitro fertilization. After mandatory retirement from Johns Hopkins, a former classmate, Dr. Mason Andrews, recruited Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones to the Eastern Virginia Medical School. They continued working on in vitro fertilization and had 41 failures before their first success, when Judith Carr gave birth to Elizabeth Carr on December 28, 1981, two days before Dr. Jones's 71st birthday. Over the years, Dr. Jones welcomed former patients who came with their toddlers to celebrate Mother's Day and baby photos adorned his office. Dr. Jones served with great distinction as Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School. He was also Professor Emeritus at Johns Hopkins where he served as Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, acting Chairman of the Department, and Secretary General of the University Program for International Education. Dr. Jones received honorary degrees from the University of Cordoba, Old Dominion University, Amherst College, the University of Madrid, and Eastern Virginia Medical School. He is the recipient of the Medal of the College of France and the Distinguished Service Award of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He launched the first ethics committee dealing with fertility as part of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. At the age of 103, he wrote In Vitro Fertilization Comes to America: Memoir of a Medical Breakthrough, retelling his amazing career. A year earlier, he published Personhood Revisited: Reproductive Technology, Bioethics, Religion and the Law, an exploration into the legal and ethical implications of fertility treatments and a perspective on pending legislation seeking to define the union of a sperm and egg as a person. Dr. Jones published a dozen books and hundreds of scientific journal articles. Dr. Jones is survived by three children, seven grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren. His son, Howard W. Jones III, MD, is Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A daughter, Georgeanna Jones Klingensmith, MD, is the Past Director of Pediatric Diabetes at the Barbara Davis Diabetes Center at the University of Colorado, and his son Lawrence Massey Jones is a Denver-based financial advisor. At a 100th birthday celebration Dr. Jones quoted his professor at Amherst in describing himself: ""Two Roads diverged in a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.""-- Robert Frost. The Board and staff of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine, millions of parents and children, and those who had the good fortune to be touched by his innovative genius and kind spirit honor the man who took the road less traveled.
