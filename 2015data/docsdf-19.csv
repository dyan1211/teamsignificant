More than 20 years after its passage, Child Health Plus and other health and human services programs initiated by Governor Cuomo continue to benefit thousands of working families -a testament to the legacy he created despite governing during some of the most austere fiscal periods in state history. The leadership and 54,000+ employees of the North Shore-LIJ Health System mourn his passing and remember him proudly for his commitment to preserving the public health.

Alan Lewis Grey, Ph.D.,ABPP, a clinical psychologist in private practice and a Professor Emeritus, Fordham University, died at his home in Manhattan on November 20, 2014. He was passionate both about his teaching and his work with patients, which continued almost until his 95th birthday. Born in the Bronx on May 30, 1919, Alan graduated from The City College of New York and obtained a masters degree in sociology from Columbia University. He served during World War II in the U.S. military, which introduced him to his life's work through an assignment in the field of psychology. With his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Chicago, Alan became a pioneer in documenting the effects of social class on mental health treatment. He studied psychoanalysis and later taught at the William Alanson White Institute, where he was deeply influenced by his close associations with Clara Thompson and Eric Fromm. In keeping with his social science education, Alan understood himself and others as both unique individuals and as intimately shaped by their social class and larger culture. This, along with his love of international travel, led to his serving for two academic years as Fulbright Senior Lecturer in India. His global adventures included a trip at the age of 88 to Morocco, where he rode a camel in the Sahara. He served for five years on the board of the International Federation of Psychoanalytic Societies. Alan edited three books and published more than 50 professional papers in journals and books. He was instrumental in securing licensure for psychologists in New York State and was a co- founder of the Westchester Center for the Study of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy. Alan could be tough-minded, competitive and dismissive of received wisdom, but his family and friends will remember him especially for his love, generosity, intelligence and wicked sense of humor. They celebrated his life at a private service on November 23, 2014. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Carolyn C. Grey, his stepdaughter, Caitlin Zaloom; her husband, Eric Klinenberg, and two grandchildren, Cyrus and Lila.

He was passionate both about his teaching and his work with patients, which continued almost until his 95th birthday. Born in the Bronx on May 30, 1919, Alan graduated from The City College of New York and obtained a masters degree in sociology from Columbia University. He served during World War II in the U.S. military, which introduced him to his life's work through an assignment in the field of psychology. With his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Chicago, Alan became a pioneer in documenting the effects of social class on mental health treatment. He studied psychoanalysis and later taught at the William Alanson White Institute, where he was deeply influenced by his close associations with Clara Thompson and Eric Fromm. In keeping with his social science education, Alan understood himself and others as both unique individuals and as intimately shaped by their social class and larger culture. This, along with his love of international travel, led to his serving for two academic years as Fulbright Senior Lecturer in India. His global adventures included a trip at the age of 88 to Morocco, where he rode a camel in the Sahara. He served for five years on the board of the International Federation of Psychoanalytic Societies. Alan edited three books and published more than 50 professional papers in journals and books. He was instrumental in securing licensure for psychologists in New York State and was a co- founder of the Westchester Center for the Study of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy. Alan could be tough-minded, competitive and dismissive of received wisdom, but his family and friends will remember him especially for his love, generosity, intelligence and wicked sense of humor. They celebrated his life at a private service on November 23, 2014. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Carolyn C. Grey, his stepdaughter, Caitlin Zaloom; her husband, Eric Klinenberg, and two grandchildren, Cyrus and Lila.

Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, mourns the loss of Ruth Popkin, who served as national president from 1984 to 1988. Mrs. Popkin passed away on Friday, January 2, 2015 at the age of 101. We have lost a leader of great dignity and accomplishment, said Marcie Natan, Hadassah's current national president. Ruth was a pillar not only of Hadassah but also of the Zionist movement. We are grateful for her years of dedication, her passion for Israel and the example she set. During Mrs. Popkin's presidency, Hadassah's projects in Israel made advances that are still felt today. At the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, technology gained momentum, reaching new frontiers in imaging and lasers, in transplant surgery and genetic engineering. Youth Aliyah took in its first wave of students from Ethiopia--who were later helpful in absorbing a much larger wave of olim. In America, Hadassah pressed forward in the struggle to repeal the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism. That campaign came to a successful conclusion in 1991. Prior to serving as national president, Mrs. Popkin served as chair of the Hadassah Medical Organization. During her more than 60 years of service to Hadassah she chaired the departments of Youth Aliyah, Youth Activities and Fundraising, among others. One of the things for which Mrs. Popkin is most remembered is serving as co-chair of Hadassah's first National Convention in Israel, in 1978. Dubbed the ""Convention Without Walls,"" it was attended by 3,000+ delegates who were transported on 65 buses to meetings and special events all over Israel. In 1987, Mrs. Popkin was elected Chair of the Presidium and President of the World Zionist Congress, the first woman ever to hold those positions. She served as a Hadassah delegate to seven Zionist Congresses, from 1966 to 2002. Immediately after her presidential term at Hadassah, she served as president of the Jewish National Fund (1989-93). Mrs. Popkin served as vice president of the National Jewish Community Relations Council (NJCRAC). She also held positions on the boards of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the American Zionist Movement, American Israel Friendship League, American Friends of the Hebrew University, United Jewish Appeal, Israel Bonds and Temple Israel of Great Neck. Ruth Popkin was born Ruth Willon in Brooklyn. She studied philosophy at Brooklyn College and in 1939 married Morris Popkin. Along with her husband, who died in 1979, Mrs. Popkin was a major donor to Hadassah.

Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, mourns the loss of Ruth Popkin, who served as national president from 1984 to 1988. Mrs. Popkin passed away on Friday, January 2, 2015 at the age of 101. We have lost a leader of great dignity and accomplishment, said Marcie Natan, Hadassah's current national president. Ruth was a pillar not only of Hadassah but also of the Zionist movement. We are grateful for her years of dedication, her passion for Israel and the example she set. During Mrs. Popkin's presidency, Hadassah's projects in Israel made advances that are still felt today. At the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, technology gained momentum, reaching new frontiers in imaging and lasers, in transplant surgery and genetic engineering. Youth Aliyah took in its first wave of students from Ethiopia--who were later helpful in absorbing a much larger wave of olim. In America, Hadassah pressed forward in the struggle to repeal the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism. That campaign came to a successful conclusion in 1991. Prior to serving as national president, Mrs. Popkin served as chair of the Hadassah Medical Organization. During her more than 60 years of service to Hadassah she chaired the departments of Youth Aliyah, Youth Activities and Fundraising, among others. One of the things for which Mrs. Popkin is most remembered is serving as co-chair of Hadassah's first National Convention in Israel, in 1978. Dubbed the ""Convention Without Walls,"" it was attended by 3,000+ delegates who were transported on 65 buses to meetings and special events all over Israel. In 1987, Mrs. Popkin was elected Chair of the Presidium and President of the World Zionist Congress, the first woman ever to hold those positions. She served as a Hadassah delegate to seven Zionist Congresses, from 1966 to 2002. Immediately after her presidential term at Hadassah, she served as president of the Jewish National Fund (1989-93). Mrs. Popkin served as vice president of the National Jewish Community Relations Council (NJCRAC). She also held positions on the boards of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the American Zionist Movement, American Israel Friendship League, American Friends of the Hebrew University, United Jewish Appeal, Israel Bonds and Temple Israel of Great Neck. Ruth Popkin was born Ruth Willon in Brooklyn. She studied philosophy at Brooklyn College and in 1939 married Morris Popkin. Along with her husband, who died in 1979, Mrs. Popkin was a major donor to Hadassah. The Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine has a Ruth and Morris Popkin Chair in Health Administration; and there is a stone-paved mall named for Morris Popkin at the Hadassah Medical Center-Ein Kerem.

Nicole was born on August 22, 1937 in Lille, France and escaped Nazi occupied Europe with her mother to Morocco and then to the United States. When her father refused to leave France, her mother remarried, and Nicole took her stepfathers last name (Barth). Nicole's career included television (""The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour,"" The ""Ed Sullivan Show"") seven Broadway shows and movies (""Mame,"" ""Enchanted""). She was, at her core, a true Broadway dancer, working with many of the greatest choreographers on Broadway. She first started taking dance class for health reasons, although her mother said she always jiggled around. In New York she trained with dance teachers Jack Stanley and Jack Pottinger where she studied tap and classical ballet. In her early career, Nicole and Ronnie Lee were weekly dance partners on ""The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour"" (later known as ""The Children's Hour"") on NBC Sunday mornings. It was said that only one out of every 150 children ages nine-eleven who auditioned ever made the show. Nicole attended the High School of Performing Arts and was part of their first graduating class. She was selected to receive the award as outstanding ballet dancer in her class, but her mother accepted the award for her, as she had already left to perform in summer stock. Nicole earned her Actors Equity card performing in ""The Student Prince"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" that year. She returned to New York, started auditioning and eventually landed her first Broadway show, ""Take Me Along,"" in 1959, produced by David Merrick and starring Walter Pidgeon and Jackie Gleason. Also making her Broadway debut in that production was Valerie Harper, with whom she retained a life-long friendship. Nicole formed many life-long friendships in her early years of performing, a testament to her professionalism, kindness and loyalty. In addition to ""Take Me Along,"" Nicole also appeared in ""Carnival,"" once again produced by David Merrick. Nicole then went into ""Nowhere to Go but Up,"" choreographed by Ron Field, with Michael Bennett as assistant choreographer. The cast also included Martin Balsam, Dorothy Loudon and Tom Bosley. Nicole was already established as a Broadway dancer when ""Hello, Dolly!"" auditions began. Gower Champion called her in and she was cast immediately as part of the ensemble. Their first performance in Detroit was November 18th, a Monday night. On Friday afternoon, November 22nd, President Kennedy was assassinated. She very clearly remembered that day. After opening on Broadway and being in the show for over a year she left the company for a short while leading up to and following the birth of her only child, Leslie. She then returned and remained with the show until Ginger Rogers departure. Other Broadway shows include ""Sugar,"" ""Dear World,"" and ""The Happy Time."" Nicole was also dance captain for ""Dear World"" and ""The Happy Time."" She was a long-time member of Dancers Over 40, and served on their board of directors from 2001-2003. She was one of five women honored at the first 2009 DO40 Legacy Awards given to members who have excelled in their field and given back to the community. Nicole performed in all their dance concerts and spoke and moderated at their yearly panels honoring the History, Legacy and Lives of her fellow dancers. Nicole is survived by her cousin, Heinz Hanau, daughter, Leslie Skinner, Leslie's husband, John, and their children, Sam and Jessica of Los Altos, CA: and longtime companion, Artie Siccardi.

Broadway dancer Nicole Barth, who appeared in several Gower Champion musicals including the original company of ""Hello, Dolly!,"" passed away on December 22nd, 2014 after battling lung cancer for six years. Nicole was born on August 22, 1937 in Lille, France and escaped Nazi occupied Europe with her mother to Morocco and then to the United States. When her father refused to leave France, her mother remarried, and Nicole took her stepfathers last name (Barth). Nicole's career included television (""The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour,"" The ""Ed Sullivan Show"") seven Broadway shows and movies (""Mame,"" ""Enchanted""). She was, at her core, a true Broadway dancer, working with many of the greatest choreographers on Broadway. She first started taking dance class for health reasons, although her mother said she always jiggled around. In New York she trained with dance teachers Jack Stanley and Jack Pottinger where she studied tap and classical ballet. In her early career, Nicole and Ronnie Lee were weekly dance partners on ""The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour"" (later known as ""The Children's Hour"") on NBC Sunday mornings. It was said that only one out of every 150 children ages nine-eleven who auditioned ever made the show. Nicole attended the High School of Performing Arts and was part of their first graduating class. She was selected to receive the award as outstanding ballet dancer in her class, but her mother accepted the award for her, as she had already left to perform in summer stock. Nicole earned her Actors Equity card performing in ""The Student Prince"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" that year. She returned to New York, started auditioning and eventually landed her first Broadway show, ""Take Me Along,"" in 1959, produced by David Merrick and starring Walter Pidgeon and Jackie Gleason. Also making her Broadway debut in that production was Valerie Harper, with whom she retained a life-long friendship. Nicole formed many life-long friendships in her early years of performing, a testament to her professionalism, kindness and loyalty. In addition to ""Take Me Along,"" Nicole also appeared in ""Carnival,"" once again produced by David Merrick. Nicole then went into ""Nowhere to Go but Up,"" choreographed by Ron Field, with Michael Bennett as assistant choreographer. The cast also included Martin Balsam, Dorothy Loudon and Tom Bosley. Nicole was already established as a Broadway dancer when ""Hello, Dolly!"" auditions began. Gower Champion called her in and she was cast immediately as part of the ensemble. Their first performance in Detroit was November 18th, a Monday night. On Friday afternoon, November 22nd, President Kennedy was assassinated. She very clearly remembered that day. After opening on Broadway and being in the show for over a year she left the company for a short while leading up to and following the birth of her only child, Leslie. She then returned and remained with the show until Ginger Rogers departure. Other Broadway shows include ""Sugar,"" ""Dear World,"" and ""The Happy Time."" Nicole was also dance captain for ""Dear World"" and ""The Happy Time."" She was a long-time member of Dancers Over 40, and served on their board of directors from 2001-2003. She was one of five women honored at the first 2009 DO40 Legacy Awards given to members who have excelled in their field and given back to the community. Nicole performed in all their dance concerts and spoke and moderated at their yearly panels honoring the History, Legacy and Lives of her fellow dancers. Nicole is survived by her cousin, Heinz Hanau, daughter, Leslie Skinner, Leslie's husband, John, and their children, Sam and Jessica of Los Altos, CA: and longtime companion, Artie Siccardi.
