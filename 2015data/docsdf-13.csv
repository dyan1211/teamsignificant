During these times, she held faculty appointments at Columbia University, NY Medical College and Cornell University-New York Hospital. In 1976, Ms. Thom became the Executive Director of the VNSNY and was responsible for many innovations there in the delivery of home health care services, retiring from that position in 1982.

He is lovingly survived by his wife of 50 years, Tobee Kaplan, his children Lyn Chasen and husband Barry Chasen, Randall Kaplan and wife Kathy Manning, Scott Kaplan and wife Maeve Kaplan, grandchildren Brandon Chasen and wife Catherine, Blake and Ben Chasen, Elizabeth, Robert and Jennifer Kaplan, Sara Kaplan Stricker and husband Elon Stricker, Sophia, Aubrey and Henry Kaplan, and great-grandson Brandon Chasen, Jr. He was predeceased by his beloved daughter Lori Kaplan. Mr. Kaplan grew up in High Point, NC, the son of the late Sara and Harry Kaplan and the brother of the late Dr. Arthur Kaplan. Forced to leave UNC to take over his father's janitorial supply company when his father became ill, he graduated from High Point University while running his family business. He served in the U.S Army during the Korean War, then returned to the business and used his determination, creativity, and hard work to build Kay Chemical Company into a worldwide supplier of cleaning chemicals to the giants of the fast food industry. When Kay merged with Ecolab in 1996, he was proud that Kay maintained its location in Greensboro and continued to thrive. Mr. Kaplan's life was guided by his desire to make the world a better place, and he had a lasting impact through his significant philanthropic efforts. With the creation of the TOLEO Foundation, he and his wife Tobee pursued a deep commitment to philanthropy in education, women and children's issues, homelessness, hunger, healthcare and human services, the arts, civil rights, and quality of life for the greater community in general and the Jewish Community in particular. Mr. Kaplan was a driving force in projects ranging from the creation of the Moses Cone Cardiac Unit, the founding of Camp Ramah Darom, and the School of Public Administration for Leadership at High Point University. He helped found pivotal agencies such as Jewish Family Services and the Jewish Foundation of Greensboro, and helped build new facilities for the Greensboro Jewish Federation, The Women's Resource Center, Habitat for Humanity, B'nai Shalom Day School, Greensboro Day School, Beth David Synagogue, Temple Emanuel, and UNC Hillel. He was a major supporter of United Way and Urban Ministries, and he funded food programs in needy areas in Eastern Europe and Israel. He was a major contributor to the arts in Greensboro, including the Tanger Center for the Performing Arts, Greensboro Symphony, EMF and Triad Stage, whose Pyrle Theater is named for his late mother-in -law Pyrle Gibson. A visionary thinker, Mr. Kaplan created two international organizations to address global needs. Through his Wealth and Giving Forum, he educated and motivated others to use their wealth for charitable purposes. With The Alliance for Global Good, he encouraged innovative solutions to poverty, health and environmental, issues, funding grants worldwide, including the building of a maternal health clinic in Ghana. Among his many awards, Mr. Kaplan received an honorary doctorate from the Jewish Theological Seminary, Greensboro Chamber of Commerce's Thomas Z. Osborne Citizen of the Year Award, Greensboro Jewish Federation's Benjamin Cone, Sr. Leadership Award, and the 2014 NCCJ Citation Award. Mr. Kaplan had deep love for his family, which always came first in his life. He was a kind, caring, deeply ethical, witty man who was fiercely loyal. His charm, intellect, warmth and resolve made the world a better place and will be sorely missed. Mr. Kaplan's funeral will take place at Beth David Synagogue, Wednesday at 11am.<br><br>

PhD the Janet and Bernard Becker Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences died at his home in St. Louis on Friday, March 27, 2015, from complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was 70. A world renowned expert on the development of the eye, Dr. Beebe was a long-time leader in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis. His research focused on early eye development and the causes and potential prevention of nuclear cataracts and glaucoma. Also a professor of cell biology and physiology, he was recently honored with the creation of an endowed lectureship in his name. In 2014, he was the recipient of a Distinguished Educator Award for Postdoctoral Research Mentoring. Dr. Beebe served in various leadership roles in the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) over the past 20 years. He served on the ARVO board of trustees from 1996-2002, and was elected ARVO President in 2000. Most recently, he was elected to a five year term as Editor-In-Chief of the ARVO journal, Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. Dr. Beebe had been chosen to receive ARVO's highest service award, the 2015 Joanne G. Angle Award, which his wife will accept on his behalf at the annual meeting in May. He earned a bachelor's degree in zoology from the University of Rhode Island in 1966, a master's degree in biomedical sciences at Brown University in 1969, and completed a doctorate in biology at the University of Virginia in 1974, where he received the Andrew Fleming Award as the outstanding graduate student in Biology. He grew up on the south shore of Long Island, NY, in intimate contact with the water. His natural curiosity and close contact with frogs and fish and many hours staring at creatures buzzing beneath the surface of the stream in his backyard awakened his interest in biology, his lifelong passion. His proximity to Great South Bay and competitive spirit resulted in his becoming an outstanding competitive sailor, receiving many trophies and filling display cases at the Sayville Yacht Club. He was on the sailing team at URI the year they captured the North American Inter-Collegiate Sailing Championship. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr. Beebe took a faculty position in the Department of Anatomy at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. During his first year at USUHS, he met and married his wife, ""the love of his life."" He eventually became Chairman of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and received two Golden Apple (teaching) awards from the medical students during his tenure there. Dr. Beebe is survived by Anne-Elizabeth B. Beebe, PA-C, his wife of 37 years; three children, Peter (Fay Bouman), Colin (Jennifer Sullivan) and Jessica (Philip Quitslund), four grandchildren; and a younger brother, Don, also a sailor, who still lives near Great South Bay on Long Island, NY.

His proximity to Great South Bay and competitive spirit resulted in his becoming an outstanding competitive sailor, receiving many trophies and filling display cases at the Sayville Yacht Club. He was on the sailing team at URI the year they captured the North American Inter-Collegiate Sailing Championship. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr. Beebe took a faculty position in the Department of Anatomy at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. During his first year at USUHS, he met and married his wife, ""the love of his life."" He eventually became Chairman of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and received two Golden Apple (teaching) awards from the medical students during his tenure there. Dr. Beebe is survived by Anne-Elizabeth B. Beebe, PA-C, his wife of 37 years; three children, Peter (Fay Bouman), Colin (Jennifer Sullivan) and Jessica (Philip Quitslund), four grandchildren; and a younger brother, Don, also a sailor, who still lives near Great South Bay on Long Island, NY. Services: There will be no funeral, but a memorial service is planned for May 16th at Washington University Medical School in St Louis, MO. Memorial contributions may be made to the Dr. David C. Beebe Lectureship Endowment Fund in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at Washington University School of Medicine.

Mr. Kaplan grew up in High Point, NC, the son of the late Sara and Harry Kaplan and the brother of the late Dr. Arthur Kaplan. Forced to leave UNC to take over his father's janitorial supply company when his father became ill, he graduated from High Point University while running his family business. He served in the U.S Army during the Korean War, then returned to the business and used his determination, creativity, and hard work to build Kay Chemical Company into a worldwide supplier of cleaning chemicals to the giants of the fast food industry. When Kay merged with Ecolab in 1996, he was proud that Kay maintained its location in Greensboro and continued to thrive. Mr. Kaplan's life was guided by his desire to make the world a better place, and he had a lasting impact through his significant philanthropic efforts.

Bobbe was born on May 16, 1916, in the hardscrabble mining town of Bisbee, AZ, and moved with her parents to Beverly Hills when Sunset Boulevard had yet to be fully paved. She was a successful business woman in the 1940s, when female entrepreneurs were a rare breed, and through the 1980s, as women increasingly rose to prominence in corporate America. She found great success in commercial and residential real estate as well in public relations. In the 1950s she handled Mark Taper's PR for his ambitious Lakewood development. With Coldwell Banker, Bobbe sold many of the more remarkable Los Angeles homes of her time, remarkable both for their lavishness and their residents. Bobbe was also an outdoors woman and athlete, fishing and riding horses. She skied and played tennis competitively, often against men. She raised and trained dogs and was a sports car enthusiast, well-known for the rainbow-painted Porsche in which she made her real estate rounds. Bobbe traveled widely throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. As a patron of the arts she greatly enjoyed classical music and in recent years, Lady Gaga. Her rapier wit and playful sense of humor was matched by her care and concern for others. Never one to talk about herself, Bobbe focused her incandescent personality on whomever she was with; her joyful presence absorbed as much as her quiet smile radiated. Bobbe leaves behind friends and classmates from Beverly Hills High School (1935, Class President), UC Berkeley and UCLA (1939, BA European History). She will be dearly missed by her family, including her niece Jeanne Meyers (Richard Carr) and nephews Charles Franklin (Susie) and Wayne Franklin (Susan); her grandnieces and nephews, Elissa (Clark Middleton) and Lucas Meyers (Margaret); Zachary Franklin (Sofia Zander), Seth Franklin (Kristin), Judd Franklin (Tybe Goldberg); and Jason Franklin, Barrett Franklin (Lea) and Shannon Hegarty (Terry); as well as by her great grandnieces and nephew, Ellington and August Meyers; Molly Franklin and Clara Zander; and Adena Franklin. Bobbe was predeceased by her younger brothers Benny (Ben Jr.) (same day as Bobbe, February 28, but 1973) and Maynard Franklin (2011). Beneficiaries of Babette's profoundly philanthropic nature include several health and educational institutes. She and her brother Maynard left the gem and mineral collection originally amassed by their parents, Ben and Clara, in Bisbee, to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, where it can now be seen by all.<br><br>

He was an investment manager with a global and historical perspective, ethical in business and in the conduct of his life. As an investor, his special gift was drawing connections between seemingly disparate events and displaying a brave and contrarian bent, setting him apart and keeping him a step ahead of others. He devoted much of his life to making sense of the most complex of matters as a way to make the world a better place. He possessed great intellectual curiosity and pragmatic wisdom which informed all his pursuits. He was a wonderful observer of economic history and a generous supporter of the work of the Joint Centers for History and Economics at Harvard and Cambridge Universities. He supported pioneering research at the RAND Corporation to articulate a vision for a successful Palestinian State, once peace is achieved. He supported a second ambitious RAND study on the costs to Israel and Palestine of continued conflict, to be released this spring. He was a member of the RAND Board of Trustees, and served on the Board of Advisors of RAND Health and RAND Center for Middle East Public Policy. He was born in Portland, Maine, the son of Robert Ladd Richards M.D. and Janice Kimball Richards and grew up in Vermont. He received a Bachelor's degree in English literature from Harvard College in 1961, a Master's in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Wadham College, Oxford in 1963, and a Master's in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School in 1965. He kept strong ties to Harvard and Wadham, as a valuable advisor and supporter, serving on the Chancellor's Court of Benefactors at Oxford and as a Foundation Fellow at Wadham, and at Harvard on Dean's Councils and the Committee on University Resources. David won three varsity letters rowing for the lightweight varsity crew at Harvard for three undefeated years in 1959, 1960 and 1961, and was elected captain in his senior year. His boat dominated its American competitors and won the E.A.R.C. Championships three years in a row. Internationally, in 1959 and 1960, the lightweights won the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, the premier rowing event in the world, setting three course records in 1960. He went on to row for the Oxford University Crew and Isis Boat Club, then coached the Harvard Lightweight Crews for two years while attending Harvard Business School. His passion for rowing continued throughout his life. David had a deep respect for the people and communities of the Maine Coast. As a citizen of the world, he enjoyed global travel. However, he nourished his spirit in Maine, walking, hiking and lobster-roll lunching with friends. For 35 years, fishermen, seals and others witnessed David on the ocean in the calm early morning hours, joyfully rowing his single shell among the islands off Stonington.

He was an investment manager with a global and historical perspective, ethical in business and in the conduct of his life. As an investor, his special gift was drawing connections between seemingly disparate events and displaying a brave and contrarian bent, setting him apart and keeping him a step ahead of others. He devoted much of his life to making sense of the most complex of matters as a way to make the world a better place. He possessed great intellectual curiosity and pragmatic wisdom which informed all his pursuits. He was a wonderful observer of economic history and a generous supporter of the work of the Joint Centers for History and Economics at Harvard and Cambridge Universities. He supported pioneering research at the RAND Corporation to articulate a vision for a successful Palestinian State, once peace is achieved. He supported a second ambitious RAND study on the costs to Israel and Palestine of continued conflict, to be released this spring. He was a member of the RAND Board of Trustees, and served on the Board of Advisors of RAND Health and RAND Center for Middle East Public Policy. He was born in Portland, Maine, the son of Robert Ladd Richards M.D. and Janice Kimball Richards and grew up in Vermont. He received a Bachelor's degree in English literature from Harvard College in 1961, a Master's in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Wadham College, Oxford in 1963, and a Master's in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School in 1965. He kept strong ties to Harvard and Wadham, as a valuable advisor and supporter, serving on the Chancellor's Court of Benefactors at Oxford and as a Foundation Fellow at Wadham, and at Harvard on Dean's Councils and the Committee on University Resources. David won three varsity letters rowing for the lightweight varsity crew at Harvard for three undefeated years in 1959, 1960 and 1961, and was elected captain in his senior year. His boat dominated its American competitors and won the E.A.R.C. Championships three years in a row. Internationally, in 1959 and 1960, the lightweights won the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, the premier rowing event in the world, setting three course records in 1960. He went on to row for the Oxford University Crew and Isis Boat Club, then coached the Harvard Lightweight Crews for two years while attending Harvard Business School. His passion for rowing continued throughout his life. David had a deep respect for the people and communities of the Maine Coast. As a citizen of the world, he enjoyed global travel. However, he nourished his spirit in Maine, walking, hiking and lobster-roll lunching with friends. For 35 years, fishermen, seals and others witnessed David on the ocean in the calm early morning hours, joyfully rowing his single shell among the islands off Stonington. He is survived by his wife, Carol, his two sons Adam and Peter, two grandchildren Theo and Ian, their mother Jane, and his brother, Robert.<br><br>

It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our dear friend and colleague Morgan B. Stark, 75, on April 13, 2015. Born in 1939 in New York, New York, Mr. Stark was a legendary investor, dedicated philanthropist and iconic teacher. He is survived by his wife of nearly half a century, Sidney, sons Nick and Mason, daughter-inlaw Jacqueline, and grandchildren Dante and Nicolette. Mr. Stark was a Managing Member of Ramius, LLC where he served most recently as the Chairman of Ramius Alternative Investments and Head of Macro Trading Strategy. Widely regarded as one of the most respected and knowledgeable investors in the industry, Mr. Stark began his career in the 1960s at Chase Manhattan Bank where he received a comprehensive grounding in syndicate management, municipal bonds, bond trading and sales management. He remained with the company in various roles until he joined Chemical Bank as Senior Vice President and Treasury Department Deputy Head in 1979. Mr. Stark's unwavering dedication to his clients and extraordinary knowledge of the financial markets propelled him into roles of increasing importance within the bank, resulting in his appointment to the role of President and CEO of Chemical Securities, Inc., in 1989. After serving in this role for four years, he joined Granite Capital International Group as a Portfolio Manager and Managing Director to develop a non-correlating investment management business. In 1995, he and Thomas W. Strauss joined Ramius as partners with Peter A. Cohen in the development of Ramius' investment management business. Mr. Stark was widely credited for working with his peers to develop Ramius into a successful alternative investment management business with his unwavering commitment to employees and clients. Mr. Stark served as a member of the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He also once chaired the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Bond Market Association, where he was a long time member. Mr. Stark attended the Cornell University Industrial Labor Relations School and held a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from New York University. He served for three and a half years in the U.S. Marine Corps. In addition to his professional accomplishments, employees recognized Mr. Stark for his generosity and commitment to the long-term welfare of his employees. As Managing Member of Ramius he advocated for employees to have access to a wide range of estate, retirement planning and health care programs and personally advised many colleagues on their use. Known as a skilled raconteur and bon vivant, Mr. Stark had no shortage of hobbies, including music, skiing and golfing. A dedicated gardener, Mr. Stark took up bee keeping in his effort to enhance his floral garden in North Haven, New York. In 2005, Mr. and Mrs. Stark were invited to dinner by legendary violinist and oenophile Itzhak Perlman. Mr. Stark, eager to share his love of fine wines, brought a 1982 Chateau Lynch-Bages. Perlman, it turns out, had planned to serve the very same Bordeaux. A quick friendship developed and Mr. Stark soon after became President of the Board of Directors of the Perlman Music Program where he committed himself to helping the Program renovate its campus to meet the future needs of young musicians. In 2011, Mr. Stark told The Wall Street Journal that his work with the Program, ""Fills my soul,"" and that the young musicians he had met, ""are people that if they don't become the next best and the greatest cello or violin player, they are likely to be doctors or lawyers. But they will be wonderful people."" Mr. Stark was active in a number of industry and philanthropic activities including his position as a member of the Investment Committee for the American Heart Association--Heritage Affiliate. He also previously served as President, Vice President, and member of the Board of Directors of the Dealer Bank Association and as a trustee to various charitable organizations including the Stires-Stark Foundation.

Stark, 75, on April 13, 2015. Born in 1939 in New York, New York, Mr. Stark was a legendary investor, dedicated philanthropist and iconic teacher. He is survived by his wife of nearly half a century, Sidney, sons Nick and Mason, daughter-inlaw Jacqueline, and grandchildren Dante and Nicolette. Mr. Stark was a Managing Member of Ramius, LLC where he served most recently as the Chairman of Ramius Alternative Investments and Head of Macro Trading Strategy. Widely regarded as one of the most respected and knowledgeable investors in the industry, Mr. Stark began his career in the 1960s at Chase Manhattan Bank where he received a comprehensive grounding in syndicate management, municipal bonds, bond trading and sales management. He remained with the company in various roles until he joined Chemical Bank as Senior Vice President and Treasury Department Deputy Head in 1979. Mr. Stark's unwavering dedication to his clients and extraordinary knowledge of the financial markets propelled him into roles of increasing importance within the bank, resulting in his appointment to the role of President and CEO of Chemical Securities, Inc., in 1989. After serving in this role for four years, he joined Granite Capital International Group as a Portfolio Manager and Managing Director to develop a non-correlating investment management business. In 1995, he and Thomas W. Strauss joined Ramius as partners with Peter A. Cohen in the development of Ramius' investment management business. Mr. Stark was widely credited for working with his peers to develop Ramius into a successful alternative investment management business with his unwavering commitment to employees and clients. Mr. Stark served as a member of the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

In addition to his professional accomplishments, employees recognized Mr. Stark for his generosity and commitment to the long-term welfare of his employees. As Managing Member of Ramius he advocated for employees to have access to a wide range of estate, retirement planning and health care programs and personally advised many colleagues on their use. Known as a skilled raconteur and bon vivant, Mr. Stark had no shortage of hobbies, including music, skiing and golfing. A dedicated gardener, Mr. Stark took up bee keeping in his effort to enhance his floral garden in North Haven, New York. In 2005, Mr. and Mrs. Stark were invited to dinner by legendary violinist and oenophile Itzhak Perlman. Mr. Stark, eager to share his love of fine wines, brought a 1982 Chateau Lynch-Bages. Perlman, it turns out, had planned to serve the very same Bordeaux. A quick friendship developed and Mr. Stark soon after became President of the Board of Directors of the Perlman Music Program where he committed himself to helping the Program renovate its campus to meet the future needs of young musicians. In 2011, Mr. Stark told The Wall Street Journal that his work with the Program, ""Fills my soul,"" and that the young musicians he had met, ""are people that if they don't become the next best and the greatest cello or violin player, they are likely to be doctors or lawyers. But they will be wonderful people."" Mr. Stark was active in a number of industry and philanthropic activities including his position as a member of the Investment Committee for the American Heart Association--Heritage Affiliate.
