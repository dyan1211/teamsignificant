Known for her summertime straw hat and roll-up-your-sleeves work attitude, Patricia Schulte Levinson died at Mount Sinai Hospital on September 8th after a brief but heroic fight with cancer. She had been active in board work and non-profit affiliations, especially as a Trustee of the Mount Sinai Healthcare System, and was a lifelong New Yorker, a lover of the arts and culture, and who enjoyed spending time with her family and in the summers at her Long Island home. Pat was the daughter of Arthur D. Schulte and Luise Meyer Schulte. She graduated from the Spence School and attended Connecticut College and Columbia University before marrying Robert A. Levinson in 1954. Pat joined the Boards of Trustees of Mount Sinai Hospital in 1981 when she was named President of the Mount Sinai Auxiliary Board, a group she first joined in 1961. Pat served on several of the hospital's board committees both as a member and chair; most recently on the Patient Care and Quality Assurance, Medical Education and Community Relations Committees. Board members grew to anticipate receiving articles and clippings from her, all on recycled paper and all pertinent to the issues of the day. For many years she also served as a Board liaison to the Nursing Department. Pat had been co-chair of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs (CMCA) Advisory Board since its inception. A champion of students, her personal commitment included the creation of the Robert and Patricia Levinson Student Center, and the endowment of scholarships and fellowships at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She was a founding member and vice president of New York City's New Alternatives for Children (NAC) where she helped children move from hospitals to loving homes, a director of Linkage House, and vice chair of the United Hospital Fund, as well as a member of Health First's Board of Managers of Senior Health Partners and a former trustee of the Blythedale Children's Hospital. Pat brought friends from all parts of her life to help grow these important causes - whether through raising awareness or opening her home for salon gatherings - always with her famous cheese crackers. She was the recipient of a United Hospital Fund Distinguished Trustee Award for her leadership, guidance, and extraordinary service to Mount Sinai as well as The Jacobi Medallion, awarded by The Mount Sinai Alumni, in recognition of her distinguished service to the Hospital and the School. An involved New Yorker, Pat enjoyed the city in particular ballet, music, theater and all the arts, and made certain that her multitude of friends shared her pleasures. Pat was a devoted wife, mother, aunt, grandmother and friend to many. She was respected for her energy, work ethic and her vast knowledge of the health care issues she worked so diligently to address in her Mount Sinai, NAC and UHF board work. Pat, born in 1933, is survived by her husband of 61 years, Robert A. Levinson, her daughter Margot and two sons, Andrew and John as well as their spouses: John Ganz, Jr, Karen Levinson, and Ronna Levinson.

For many years she also served as a Board liaison to the Nursing Department. Pat had been co-chair of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs (CMCA) Advisory Board since its inception. A champion of students, her personal commitment included the creation of the Robert and Patricia Levinson Student Center, and the endowment of scholarships and fellowships at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She was a founding member and vice president of New York City's New Alternatives for Children (NAC) where she helped children move from hospitals to loving homes, a director of Linkage House, and vice chair of the United Hospital Fund, as well as a member of Health First's Board of Managers of Senior Health Partners and a former trustee of the Blythedale Children's Hospital. Pat brought friends from all parts of her life to help grow these important causes - whether through raising awareness or opening her home for salon gatherings - always with her famous cheese crackers. She was the recipient of a United Hospital Fund Distinguished Trustee Award for her leadership, guidance, and extraordinary service to Mount Sinai as well as The Jacobi Medallion, awarded by The Mount Sinai Alumni, in recognition of her distinguished service to the Hospital and the School. An involved New Yorker, Pat enjoyed the city in particular ballet, music, theater and all the arts, and made certain that her multitude of friends shared her pleasures. Pat was a devoted wife, mother, aunt, grandmother and friend to many. She was respected for her energy, work ethic and her vast knowledge of the health care issues she worked so diligently to address in her Mount Sinai, NAC and UHF board work. Pat, born in 1933, is survived by her husband of 61 years, Robert A. Levinson, her daughter Margot and two sons, Andrew and John as well as their spouses: John Ganz, Jr, Karen Levinson, and Ronna Levinson. Pat and Bob have five grandsons: Craig, Jamie, Kyle, Jack and Dean. Pat was pre-deceased by her brother Anthony M. Schulte.

Beloved husband, father, teacher, and friend, passed away Saturday, September 12, 2015, at the age of 88 years. His life-long love of music is his legacy to those who knew and loved him, and he generously shared that love with his world. Mr. Ligotti was born in Bronx, NY where he lived until 1968 when he moved to Athens, GA with his wife and daughters to begin a teaching career at the University of Georgia's Music Department. An Associate Professor Emeritus of Music, he served on the music faculty for 27 years teaching trumpet and conducting. He was the founder and director of the UGA Wind Ensemble, played in the UGA Faculty Brass Quintet, and served as music director of the Opera/MusicTheatre in association with the UGA Department of Drama and Theatre. Prior to his appointment at UGA, Mr. Ligotti performed as a professional trumpet player for eleven years with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leonard Bernstein. He also performed with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the Boston Pops with Arthur Fiedler, as trumpet soloist with the Knickerbocker Chamber Players, the New York City Opera and Ballet companies, the Goldman Band, the Bell Telephone Television Orchestra, the Radio City Music Hall Orchestra, in Broadway show ensembles, and in brass quintets. Mr. Ligotti studied conducting under Michael Fiviesky with coaching from Pierre Monteaux. He held a bachelor's degree from Queen's College and a master's degree from Columbia University. He was active as an adjudicator, clinician, and guest conductor throughout the southeast and arranged and transcribed music, with many works published and professionally recorded. His accomplishments include election to full membership in the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He was the recipient of the 1999-2000 Bank of America Man of Achievement Award and received the Distinguished Alumni Music Award from Queen's College. As a young man just graduated from Queen's College, he chose to serve his country by enlisting in the United States Coast Guard and was a member of their distinguished Coast Guard Band. The Band developed an international reputation as one of the finest professional concert bands in the world, offering music of great variety and appeal, and he was proud and privileged to be a part of that organization. In the late 1970s, Mr. Ligotti was approached about forming a community orchestra in the Athens, GA area. With the help of the then Office of Cultural Affairs and Jill Read, its director, the plans went ahead, and in the Fall of 1978 the first Board of Directors was selected and the Symphony's charter received from the State of Georgia. In the month of January 1979, the Symphony began rehearsing in the band room of Clarke Central High School and subsequently presented its first concert on April 29, 1979, in Mell Auditorium. Thereafter, under his leadership, grateful musicians who had been given the opportunity to play before family, friends and the community through the Athens Symphony performed consistently before enthusiastic audiences of 2,000 in the Classic Center. Due to health considerations, in 2012 Mr. Ligotti handed over his baton to Susan Dinwiddie, and the Symphony Orchestra, that marvelous gift to the Athens community begun so long ago, continues to this day. Patrons of the Athens Symphony continue to be delighted with the elegant bronze sculpture of Maestro Albert Ligotti produced by Gregory Johnson, Artist. This sculpture can be seen in the lobby of the Classic Center. the Symphony's home since 1996. Mr. Ligotti is survived by his loving wife of 50 years Arlene F.

His life-long love of music is his legacy to those who knew and loved him, and he generously shared that love with his world. Mr. Ligotti was born in Bronx, NY where he lived until 1968 when he moved to Athens, GA with his wife and daughters to begin a teaching career at the University of Georgia's Music Department. An Associate Professor Emeritus of Music, he served on the music faculty for 27 years teaching trumpet and conducting. He was the founder and director of the UGA Wind Ensemble, played in the UGA Faculty Brass Quintet, and served as music director of the Opera/MusicTheatre in association with the UGA Department of Drama and Theatre. Prior to his appointment at UGA, Mr. Ligotti performed as a professional trumpet player for eleven years with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leonard Bernstein. He also performed with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the Boston Pops with Arthur Fiedler, as trumpet soloist with the Knickerbocker Chamber Players, the New York City Opera and Ballet companies, the Goldman Band, the Bell Telephone Television Orchestra, the Radio City Music Hall Orchestra, in Broadway show ensembles, and in brass quintets. Mr. Ligotti studied conducting under Michael Fiviesky with coaching from Pierre Monteaux. He held a bachelor's degree from Queen's College and a master's degree from Columbia University. He was active as an adjudicator, clinician, and guest conductor throughout the southeast and arranged and transcribed music, with many works published and professionally recorded. His accomplishments include election to full membership in the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He was the recipient of the 1999-2000 Bank of America Man of Achievement Award and received the Distinguished Alumni Music Award from Queen's College. As a young man just graduated from Queen's College, he chose to serve his country by enlisting in the United States Coast Guard and was a member of their distinguished Coast Guard Band. The Band developed an international reputation as one of the finest professional concert bands in the world, offering music of great variety and appeal, and he was proud and privileged to be a part of that organization. In the late 1970s, Mr. Ligotti was approached about forming a community orchestra in the Athens, GA area. With the help of the then Office of Cultural Affairs and Jill Read, its director, the plans went ahead, and in the Fall of 1978 the first Board of Directors was selected and the Symphony's charter received from the State of Georgia. In the month of January 1979, the Symphony began rehearsing in the band room of Clarke Central High School and subsequently presented its first concert on April 29, 1979, in Mell Auditorium. Thereafter, under his leadership, grateful musicians who had been given the opportunity to play before family, friends and the community through the Athens Symphony performed consistently before enthusiastic audiences of 2,000 in the Classic Center. Due to health considerations, in 2012 Mr. Ligotti handed over his baton to Susan Dinwiddie, and the Symphony Orchestra, that marvelous gift to the Athens community begun so long ago, continues to this day. Patrons of the Athens Symphony continue to be delighted with the elegant bronze sculpture of Maestro Albert Ligotti produced by Gregory Johnson, Artist. This sculpture can be seen in the lobby of the Classic Center. the Symphony's home since 1996. Mr. Ligotti is survived by his loving wife of 50 years Arlene F. Ligotti, daughter Fran Rothman Prince of Athens, GA, and his brother Raymond Ligotti of Long Island, NY. He was preceded in death by his daughter Jeannie Rothman and his parents Victor and Tilly Ligotti of Athens, GA. Lord & Stephens Funeral Home, Athens, GA, is in charge of services.
