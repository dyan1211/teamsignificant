I use extra virgin olive oil that isn't too strong (I find that some very dark green Tuscan oils can be overpowering), and sometimes I add walnut oil to the mix.

<p>As nutritious as salad greens are, we're not rabbits. We can't live on lettuce alone.

Since I've never seen a sandwich that I want to eat in an airport, I like to pack a lunch, something portable and easy. The problem: my homemade sandwiches used to get soggy.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to me that the whole wheat sesame hamburger buns I buy at Trader Joe's never get soggy, even when slathered with ketchup. And sandwiches on rolls are often wonderful: in France, there's the Ni&#231;oise salad in a bun or baguette called pan bagnat (bathed bread), and in Mexico I've come across delicious sandwiches in Puebla (called cemitas) and in Veracruz state (pambazos).</p>
<p>All of them are essentially salads with some added protein pressed between two halves of a roll. The rolls can be hard in the authentic versions, but I prefer a soft roll - when you bite on a hard crust, you have to bite down so hard that the filling oozes out. The hamburger bun is perfect.</p>
<p>A sandwich in a bun also is easy to cut in half. When I tested these recipes, I found that half of any of this week's sandwiches will make a filling meal. They wrap and keep so well that I enjoyed eating a second half for lunch or dinner even after it had been refrigerated for a day.</p>

149,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Tahini,525ee61579881001a358a0b9,,"<p>When I come home hungry from a late afternoon swim, my idea of a perfect snack is a piece of toast topped with sesame tahini, a paste made from lightly toasted hulled sesame seeds. It's very satisfying, lighter than bread topped with almond butter or peanut butter. It's a healthy snack, too: sesame seeds contain copper and manganese, as well as calcium, iron, vitamin B1 and dietary fiber.</p>
<p>Sesame has been cultivated for longer than any other seed, according to nutritionist and author Jonny Bowden. While Asian sesame paste is made with unhulled seeds, the Middle Eastern paste is made with hulled seeds. It has a mild, nutty flavor and a wonderful creamy (bordering on runny) texture. An essential ingredient in many signature Middle Eastern dishes, among them hummus and baba ganoush, tahini is also the main ingredient in pungent dipping sauces served with falafel, keftes and vegetables.</p>
<p>As sesame tahini sits, the oil separates, so the mixture should be stirred before it's used. Sesame tahini should be slightly runny - virtually all of the imported brands that I use have this consistency, but domestic versions can be thick and pasty, and a bit flavorless. You can find imported tahini in Mediterranean markets and in many grocery stores. It must be stored in the refrigerator once opened.</p>

I steam mollusks like mussels and clams in wine in a wide pan or a pot, and serve them with the broth. On warm nights, I love to grill fish outdoors.</p>
<p>Sometimes I serve fish simply, with fresh herbs, lemon and its own cooking juices. But I also like to combine robust fish with gutsy tomato-based Mediterranean sauces, or with some of the nut-based sauces I described a few weeks ago.</p>

Though the name suggests that tomatillos are small green  tomatoes, they are not. They&#8217;re in the same family as tomatoes but more  closely related to the cape gooseberry and surrounded by a similar  papery husk. Always look for tomatillos that have filled their husks, as  they are not fully mature until they do. Remove the husks, then rinse  the tomatillos, which will be sticky, and they&#8217;re ready to cook.</p>
<p>Tomatillos have a rounder, fruitier and more acidic flavor and a  richer texture than regular green tomatoes. I wouldn&#8217;t try to substitute  one for the other.

If you can find only  canned tomatillos, an 11-ounce can be substituted for 1 pound of fresh  tomatillos in this week&#8217;s recipes. The canned variety has already been  simmered until softened, and all you have to do is drain them. Cooking  by simmering or, preferably, broiling is the first step in all of my  tomatillo recipes; skip this step if you&#8217;re working with canned.</p>

165,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Fish,527a9a9e79881054c2093b19,,"<p>Nutritionists are increasingly enthusiastic about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, present in fatty, cold water fish such as tuna, mackerel and salmon, as well as in some nuts and vegetable oils. The benefits of regularly eating these foods include lower triglyceride levels and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease, studies have found. Experts are also researching a possible role for omega-3s in boosting the immune system and protecting against hypertension, depression and other ailments.</p>
<p>As the findings continue to roll in, many nutritionists now recommend that we eat fish twice a week. This can be difficult if you have no good source of quality seafood or find it too expensive. But the good news is that omega-3s are present in some types of canned fish. Sardines packed in olive oil, for instance, are delicious if you know what to do with them. Tuna is another great source of omega-3s; just make sure to seek out canned light tuna, which is made with skipjack, a smaller species that is not at risk of extinction. Skipjack contains approximately one-third the mercury levels of the albacore used in other canned tuna.</p>
<p>When shopping for fresh tuna, however, albacore from the United States and Canada is the best choice as far as the environment is concerned.

<p>&#160;</p>",Health,Fitness & Nutrition,"Recipes for Health: Fish <p>Nutritionists are increasingly enthusiastic about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, present in fatty, cold water fish such as tuna, mackerel and salmon, as well as in some nuts and vegetable oils. The benefits of regularly eating these foods include lower triglyceride levels and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease, studies have found. Experts are also researching a possible role for omega-3s in boosting the immune system and protecting against hypertension, depression and other ailments.</p>
<p>As the findings continue to roll in, many nutritionists now recommend that we eat fish twice a week. This can be difficult if you have no good source of quality seafood or find it too expensive. But the good news is that omega-3s are present in some types of canned fish. Sardines packed in olive oil, for instance, are delicious if you know what to do with them. Tuna is another great source of omega-3s; just make sure to seek out canned light tuna, which is made with skipjack, a smaller species that is not at risk of extinction. Skipjack contains approximately one-third the mercury levels of the albacore used in other canned tuna.</p>

Peppers are very low in calories (about 25 calories per cup), and red peppers in particular are an excellent source of vitamins C, A and B6, as well as a very good source of potassium and vitamin K. By weight, red bell peppers contain three times as much vitamin C as citrus fruit. They also contain lycopene, a carotenoid found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables. Some research has suggested that lycopene helps fight certain kinds of cancer.

Peppers offer the cook endless possibilities. Roast them and they become a household staple, useful for snacks, salads and quick toppings for sandwiches and bruschetta.

After selecting your base, you can choose from a wide selection of added dried fruits, nuts and ""extras."" (Unfortunately there are some questionable options, like M&amp;M's and gummy bears, which negate the virtues of the healthy base). Then they send you the granola with your own customized label.</p>
<p>If you like hot cereal for breakfast and you're not familiar with steel-cut oats, I urge you to try them. Also known as Irish or Scottish oatmeal, steel-cut oats are creamy and chewy at the same time. Since steel-cut oatmeal takes a while to cook and doesn't really work in the microwave, I've been cooking up a pot one night a week, then heating it by the bowl in the morning.</p>
<p>If a bowl of cereal isn't your thing, there are other ways to work whole grains into your breakfast. I add softened rolled oats to buttermilk pancakes and granola to muffins, which are handy if you are a grab-something-and-run sort of breakfast eater.</p>

205,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Corn,525ee5f179881001a358a066,,"<p>When I was growing up in Connecticut, corn was on the table every summer night. ""It's a short season,"" my father would say, passing around the platter for the fourth time. My mother would steam the ears in a huge canner and heap them onto a big kitchen towel on a platter, then wrap the towel around them to keep them warm. She might also make a big platter of ripe beefsteak tomatoes and meat of some kind. But when fresh corn was on the menu, we hardly noticed anything else. Our family of six could go through two dozen ears at a sitting.</p>
<p>These days, corn is bred to be sweet, and the taste depends less than it once did on the perfect moment for harvest and getting it to your plate shortly thereafter. Some say the new hybrid sweet corn will never taste as sweet as the old-fashioned corn of my childhood, but I'm not sure how much I really mind. Sweet corn is still pretty wonderful, and summer is the season for it.</p>
<p>Corn is a grain that we treat like a vegetable when we eat it fresh, on or off the cob. It should only be cooked for four or five minutes, and the sooner after you buy it, the better. Steaming is the easiest way to cook corn on the cob.</p>
<p>Corn is a good source of several nutrients, including thiamin (vitamin B1), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), folate, dietary fiber, vitamin C, phosphorus and manganese. A cup of corn supplies 19 percent of the recommended daily dose of folate and about a quarter of daily value for thiamin.</p>

237,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Asparagus,525ee5e579881001a358a04b,,"<p>Fresh asparagus is available in greenmarkets in the East and Midwest through the end of June. But here in California, the season began a few months ago - a great thing, as this is a vegetable I never tire of. There's a lot you can do with asparagus besides just eating it unadorned, steamed for five minutes or - if you've got nice, fat stalks - roasted. Delicate, thin stalks go wonderfully with eggs, either stirred into scrambled eggs or tossed with a vinaigrette and finely chopped hard-boiled eggs. I love to toss asparagus with pasta, and I often use it in soups. Children seem to like it, too. If the family table has seen too much broccoli, asparagus makes a fine alternative.</p>
<p>When cooking asparagus, you must first break off the tough stem ends by bending the stalk. Save and simmer the ends to make a delicious broth. (In traditional Indian and Chinese medicine, the ends are commended for their diuretic properties and used to ""strengthen"" the reproductive system.)</p>
<p>The tender, edible part of this lovely plant is an excellent source of vitamin K, folate, vitamin C and vitamin A, as well as a very good source of a number of other nutrients, including tryptophan, B vitamins, manganese, dietary fiber, phosphorus and potassium. All this comes in a very low-calorie package: there are about 40 calories in a cup of cooked asparagus.</p>

<p>""Lenten feast"" may sound like an oxymoron, but the Greeks have been fasting in accordance with the Greek Orthodox calendar for hundreds of years, and they have developed an extraordinary repertory of vegetarian dishes. For a little less than half the year (48 days before Easter, 40 days before Christmas, and various lesser fasting periods), observant Greeks abstain from all animal products except certain shellfish and mollusks.

I decided that rather than light the oven I would cook everything as quickly as I could on top of the stove. With the bounteous end of summer produce at my local farmers&#8217; markets, it was a perfect week for stir-frying.</p>
<p>When it comes to stir-frying, I have a guru, the cookbook author <a href=""http://www.graceyoung.com/"">Grace Young</a>. Her new cookbook, &#8220;Stir-Frying to the Sky&#8217;s Edge,&#8221; is the ultimate guide, whether you&#8217;re a beginner or a chef. I was so inspired by the book that I went out and bought a new 14-inch flat-bottomed carbon steel wok with a long wooden handle that doesn&#8217;t get hot when I cook over a high flame.</p>
<p>In the past I&#8217;ve been somewhat resistant to making Asian dishes, mainly because I&#8217;m more accustomed to the slow pace of Mediterranean cooking. But as I reacquainted myself with stir-frying under Grace Young&#8217;s tutelage, I realized that the leisurely part is preparing and arranging the ingredients. Ingredient lists may look long at first glance, which can make you think that the recipe is long or difficult. But few stir-fries take more than five minutes to cook from start to finish. The only real time is spent in the chopping and measuring. It pays to do this systematically; have everything measured out and in a small bowl, ramekin or other container, within arm&#8217;s reach of your pan, and preferably arranged in the order in which you&#8217;ll be adding it. I find that it&#8217;s much easier to stir-fry if you read the recipe through several times &#8212; memorize the steps, in fact &#8212; because once those ingredients hit the hot wok, you don&#8217;t want to have to stop to read.</p>
<p>Another important tip I learned is to make sure your ingredients, particularly the vegetables, are dry. Otherwise you will be braising instead of stir-frying. This means that when you wash vegetables, dry them on kitchen towels or paper towels. Blot <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tofu/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"">tofu</a> dry, and if you blanch a vegetable first, make sure to drain and dry on towels.

But the stir-frying itself is not a do-ahead type of cooking; it only takes a few minutes, start to finish. The table should be set and the rice ready to serve.

255,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Béchamel,525ee5e879881001a358a052,,"<p>One of the mainstays of classic French cuisine is the white sauce called b&#233;chamel, a ""mother sauce"" from which many others are made, including the famously rich sauce mornay. Although b&#233;chamel is often referred to as a cream sauce, there is rarely any cream in it. What gives it a rich texture is the suspension of a paste called a roux, made with flour and fat, in a liquid - milk in a classic b&#233;chamel, or stock in another French ""cream"" sauce called v&#233;lout&#233;.</p>
<p>Though the classic French b&#233;chamel and Italian besciamella are made with butter, in Provence cooks often use olive oil - and olive oil b&#233;chamel is delicious and surprisingly healthful.</p>
<p>In Provence you're most likely to find a b&#233;chamel napping cooked vegetables in a gratin, baked until the casserole is bubbling and lightly colored on the top. Indeed, you can gussy up any number of vegetables that have been simply steamed or parboiled with olive oil b&#233;chamel.</p>
<p>A typical Italian use for this sauce is a lasagna. The vegetarian lasagnas I make with it don't include lots of heavy cheese, just vegetables, pasta and Parmesan.</p>
<p>If you're new to cooking, you may have steered away from French sauces, but they are not difficult to make. The first step is making the roux: you simply combine the two ingredients and stir over medium heat for about five minutes until the mixture has a texture resembling wet sand and no longer has a raw, floury taste.</p>
<p>Then you add the milk, and whisk until the sauce thickens. It will do so as soon as it reaches a simmer. Then it's just a question of simmering the sauce for about 10 minutes until velvety.</p>
<p>In cooking school, you'll hear that the sauce must be simmered for at least 20 minutes in order for the roux to be properly dispersed in the liquid and to reach its maximum viscosity.

<p>People do have strong feelings about eggplant. If they don&#8217;t like it, they usually cite its bitterness or heaviness. Salting does improve eggplant&#8217;s texture if it&#8217;s to be fried, Parsons notes, but that&#8217;s the only reason to purge it.</p>

I get around frying eggplant, even in dishes where eggplant is saut&#233;ed, by roasting it first. Then I cut it into pieces and cook it again with the other ingredients in the dish.

259,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Oils,525ee60579881001a358a095,,"<p>Drizzling oils are richly flavored, most of them unrefined nut and seed oils that are best used uncooked, in salad dressings &#8213; usually in conjunction with a neutral oil like grapeseed &#8213; and drizzled over foods. They impart the distinct flavor of the nuts and seeds from which they&#8217;re extracted; all the more so if they are made from toasted nuts. My favorites are walnut oil, dark sesame oil and unrefined expeller-pressed roasted peanut oil. These are also the most affordable of the nut oils &#8213; others, like pistachio, hazelnut, pumpkin seed and pecan oil, are very dear indeed, a splurge for a drizzle.</p>
<p>Flavored or scented oils also fall into the drizzling group. These are usually neutral oils (though olive oil is used for some, like lemon oil and pili pili) that are infused with highly flavored ingredients. The most extravagant of these is truffle oil, but you can get a great bang out of less expensive flavored oils like lemon oil, wasabi oil and porcini oil, all of which can be found in gourmet groceries and online. Lately I&#8217;ve been drizzling wasabi oil over simply cooked fish and grains; a little goes a long way.</p>
<p>When it comes to cooking oils, some of which I also use in salad dressings in conjunction with aromatic nut and olive oils, many people decide on those with the highest smoke points, the temperature at which a cooking fat begins to break down and deteriorate, which can have health implications as when fats break down they can release free radicals.</p>
<p>For now, I still use organic canola oil for much of my non-olive oil cooking and baking. Made from a traditionally created hybrid derived from rapeseed, canola oil is one of the healthiest oils, with the lowest saturated fat content of any oil (7 percent, as opposed to 15 percent in olive oil). It&#8217;s an excellent source of the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid and the omega-3 fatty acid ALA, important nutrients that must come from dietary sources. But I know from the many e-mails I&#8217;ve received from readers that many people shun canola oil. This is mainly a reaction to myths that have circulated on the Internet about its perils; they are based on the misperception that the oil is made from rapeseed, which contains high levels of erucic acid, a compound that can be toxic to humans. The canola plant was developed by natural crossbreeding from the rapeseed plant, and contains very low levels of erucic acid. On the other hand, genetically engineered canola plant seeds have been used for pest-resistant plants, and this is a problem for me.</p>
<p>In my kitchen, extra virgin olive oil remains the king of oils. It falls into both the drizzling and the cooking groups. I don&#8217;t use it simply because it&#8217;s a healthy oil, high in monounsaturated fats and trace nutrients that probably contribute to its antioxidant properties; I use it because it is the traditional oil used in the Mediterranean cuisines I love. Readers have questioned the low smoke point of olive oil; this is not really a consideration for most of my cooking, because the dishes I use it in do not require a high enough temperature for it to matter. Indeed, the smoke point of olive oil is only relatively low, 375 degrees, the temperature oil needs to be at for deep-frying. But you should never waste extra virgin olive oil on deep frying in any case; if you do need a Mediterranean flavor, use extra light olive oil, which is considerably cheaper and has a smoke point of 468 degrees.</p>

<p>Inside its thick skin lies a crisp, juicy vegetable that I like equally raw or cooked.

Kohlrabi is an excellent source of potassium and a good source of vitamin C and fiber, and it&#8217;s low in calories. The purple variety that some farmers grow also contains anthocyanins, another phytonutrient with antioxidant potential.</p>
<p>If you can get kohlrabi with the greens attached, cook them as you would turnip greens or kale. The greens are never quite as copious as the greens on a bunch of turnips, but they make a nice addition to most kohlrabi dishes. It&#8217;s important when you cook with kohlrabi to peel it thoroughly. Beneath the thick, hard skin is another fibrous layer, which should also be peeled away. The fibers will not soften when cooked, and they can get stuck in your throat.

Kale is a versatile green that serves as a fine inspiration for a soup or a stew, a pasta or a gratin. Because the leaves of this Brassica family vegetable are so sturdy, kale stands up to longer cooking than do chard and beet greens. And while greens like spinach and chard readily suffer from overcooking, stewed kale has a sweet flavor.
<p>Kale is in the same family of vegetables as cabbage. (Italians call black kale cavolo nero, or black cabbage.) Like its cousins, kale is packed with health-promoting sulfur compounds, and it has been found to have the greatest antioxidant capacity of all fruits and vegetables. It's an excellent source of vitamins K, A and C, as well as manganese, and a very good source of dietary fiber, calcium, iron and potassium. All of this nutritional value comes in a low-calorie package.</p>
<p>Supermarkets generally stock curly kale, the variety with the sturdy, silvery green, ruffled leaves. At farmers' markets you'll find several other varieties, including the dark green cavolo nero, plum-red Redbor kale and red Russian kale, which has purplish leaves and red veins. They can be used interchangeably unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Kale can be simmered for long periods, or it can be blanched and then quickly pan-cooked in olive oil. Long-simmered kale yields a sweet, nourishing ""pot liquor"" that you will want to sop up with bread or even sip with a spoon. Kale loses its bright color as it simmers and the flavor of the leaves is strong, but the overall effect is sweet and comforting. The pan-cooked kale is brighter, both in color and flavor, but it will yield much less to serve, because kale loses volume when it's blanched. Simmered kale, on the other hand, first collapses in the pan, then swells as it cooks.</p>

283,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Yogurt,525ee61b79881001a358a0c8,,"<p>There has been considerable controversy this year over whether certain brands of bacteria-laden yogurt really help aid digestive health, but don’t let the hullabaloo sour you on yogurt.

If they survive the pasteurization process, you should find the bacteria -- usually Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria -- listed on the container among the ingredients, right after milk. Both types have long reputations as probiotics, bacteria that are beneficial to the intestinal tract and immune system. Beyond that, yogurt is a terrific source of protein and calcium. Many people who are otherwise lactose-intolerant can digest it.

Still, health isn’t the reason that yogurt is a staple of cuisines in the Caucasus, Balkans, Mediterranean and India. Yogurt is wonderful to cook with, much more than a breakfast food, and this week’s recipes will showcase a variety of dishes made with it.

Look for plain, minimally processed brands with no added gums, stabilizers or sweeteners. I prefer low-fat to nonfat, which can be watery and sour, and may contain fewer fat-soluble vitamins.

<p>When you toast corn tortillas in the oven, they just get hard, with no crispy snap. When you toast them in the microwave, you get the snap. But this method requires a little patience: Zap a tortilla for a minute and it will be soggy, even wet, on the bottom. Flip it over and zap it again, and all the moisture will be gone. Sometimes it takes a few turns, as every microwave is different; you&#8217;ll have to figure out the timing with yours. In my microwave I zap for one minute, turn the tortillas over, zap for another, then sometimes need to zap for 30 seconds to a minute longer to get a browned chip with snap. You have to watch closely, though, as they&#8217;ll burn quickly once dry. It can be a tedious process if you want to make a lot of chips, but for main-dish tostadas I just cut my tortillas in half to facilitate eating (they could also be left whole), and it doesn&#8217;t take very long.

<p>Bulgur, a Middle Eastern staple made from durum wheat, is a case in point. Bulgur is made by boiling hard wheat berries until they are about to crack open, then allowing them to dry, at which point the outer bran layers are rubbed off and the grains are ground. The process of boiling the wheat berries dissolves some of the soluble vitamins and minerals in the outer bran layers of the seeds, but these nutrients are absorbed back into the endosperm of the grain during cooking.</p>
<p>Bulgur comes in one of four grades: fine (bags are often labeled #1), medium (#2), coarse (#3) and very coarse (#4). The different grinds are used for specific types of dishes. Pilafs are made with medium, coarse or very coarse bulgur. Tabbouleh and kibbe are made with fine bulgur.</p>
<p>This is a convenient grain to keep on hand in the pantry. It's easy to find in whole foods stores and in Middle Eastern markets. Don't confuse it with cracked wheat, which is another product made from raw wheat berries. Because bulgur is made from precooked wheat berries, it takes only about 20 minutes to reconstitute by soaking or by simmering. It has a wonderful nutty flavor and a light texture.</p>

302,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Green Beans,525ee5fa79881001a358a07c,,"<p>Green beans are my go-to spring vegetable. They need absolutely no embellishment, just proper cooking - and for this vegetable, proper cooking is simply a matter of timing. If they're underdone, they might be nice and crunchy and pretty, but you won't get the maximum flavor, which can only be drawn out with four to five (my preference is five) minutes of cooking, either steaming or par-boiling. If you cook green beans too long, they lose that bright color and become mushy. Still, the longer-cooked Mediterranean bean stews I've tasted are full of flavor; I'm giving you one of those delicious recipes this week.</p>
<p>Green beans will contribute a number of nutrients to your diet, including folate, easily absorbed by the body due to a couple of amino acids also present in this vegetable.

<p>&#160;</p>",Health,Fitness & Nutrition,"Recipes for Health: Green Beans <p>Green beans are my go-to spring vegetable. They need absolutely no embellishment, just proper cooking - and for this vegetable, proper cooking is simply a matter of timing. If they're underdone, they might be nice and crunchy and pretty, but you won't get the maximum flavor, which can only be drawn out with four to five (my preference is five) minutes of cooking, either steaming or par-boiling. If you cook green beans too long, they lose that bright color and become mushy. Still, the longer-cooked Mediterranean bean stews I've tasted are full of flavor; I'm giving you one of those delicious recipes this week.</p>

The wide, flat leaves are easy to clean and are at home on their own -- simmered with onion, garlic and olive oil for 30 to 45 minutes, or in the company of grains or beans. They also make very nice wrappers. The next time you make stuffed vegetables, try collard greens instead of cabbage or grape leaves.</p>

348,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Dinner for One,525ee5f379881001a358a06a,,"<p>Healthy dinners for one person can be a challenge. Sitting down at a table alone and savoring a meal prepared for oneself seems to be a foreign concept to singles with empty refrigerators, accustomed to eating on the run. Even those who do cook are likely to be put off by recipes sufficient to feed four or six.</p>
<p>But eating alone can be a relaxing, almost meditative experience. In their new book, ""Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life,"" Lilian Cheung, a nutritionist at Harvard, and Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist teacher, give important advice to dieters about using Buddhist techniques of mindfulness to control overeating. When you eat alone, you have the opportunity to put these techniques into practice. Preparing a meal just for yourself can give you an opportunity to really contemplate what you eat.</p>
<p>This week I'm focusing on easy dinners for one. Get into the habit of stocking your refrigerator with items that keep well, and meals will become more fun and less challenging. Produce like cabbage, red peppers, celery and carrots will stay viable for a couple of weeks, if you don't keep them wrapped in plastic. Eggs, too, have a long shelf life in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>In the pantry, keep grains like quinoa, rice, canned beans and lentils. Keep a good loaf of whole grain bread - sliced - in the freezer, so that you can pull out a slice or two for quick panini without having to watch the rest of the loaf go stale.</p>
<p>If you know you'll eat it within two days, pick up a piece of fish at the market - a fish dinner is a great treat when you're on your own. And you can almost always halve the quantities in a tempting recipe that feeds four to six, and eat the leftovers the next day.</p>

757,,,topic,Recipes for Health: Gluten-Free Pasta,525ee5f979881001a358a07a,,"<p>My sister and a number of my friends are sensitive to gluten, a protein in wheat and other grains, and for them that has meant living without pasta. Now, though, there are a number of gluten-free pastas on the market. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a few of them, including rice sticks &#8212; Asian rice noodles that have been sitting in my pantry for years, it seems, yet never deteriorate.</p>
<p>My conclusion: If you are among the legions concerned about dietary gluten, these noodles may have a place in your future. The main trick to using gluten-free pasta is to follow the cooking directions to the letter. If you cook the pasta for too long, it falls apart. If you fail to cook it long enough, it becomes rubbery. Here are some types that I&#8217;ve had success with:</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Andean Dream quinoa pasta</span>: Available at Whole Foods, this pasta is made from a mixture of organic rice flour and organic quinoa flour from royal quinoa, a variety grown in Bolivia that is exceptionally high in protein. The spaghetti takes a good 15 minutes to cook, but the macaroni only takes six to seven minutes. It makes a good choice for dishes like <em style=""font-style: italic"">pasta e fagiole</em> (recipe below), because it won&#8217;t become soggy.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Brown rice pasta</span>: I use the house brand from my local Trader Joe&#8217;s, but it&#8217;s no different from other brands. The brown rice fusilli takes about nine minutes to cook and resembles regular pasta in feel and flavor.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Papadini pasta</span>: Available online at <a href=""http://www.eatitworld.com/"">Eatitworld.com</a>, this pasta is made from flours ground from urad legumes, such as green lentils and mung beans.

<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Rice noodles</span>: Also known as rice sticks, these glassy rice flour noodles are delicate and versatile. Available in Asian grocery stores, they require a 20-minute soak in warm water to reconstitute, then one to one and one-half minutes of cooking in boiling water.</p>",Health,Fitness & Nutrition,"Recipes for Health: Gluten-Free Pasta <p>My sister and a number of my friends are sensitive to gluten, a protein in wheat and other grains, and for them that has meant living without pasta. Now, though, there are a number of gluten-free pastas on the market. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a few of them, including rice sticks &#8212; Asian rice noodles that have been sitting in my pantry for years, it seems, yet never deteriorate.</p>
<p>My conclusion: If you are among the legions concerned about dietary gluten, these noodles may have a place in your future. The main trick to using gluten-free pasta is to follow the cooking directions to the letter. If you cook the pasta for too long, it falls apart. If you fail to cook it long enough, it becomes rubbery. Here are some types that I&#8217;ve had success with:</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Andean Dream quinoa pasta</span>: Available at Whole Foods, this pasta is made from a mixture of organic rice flour and organic quinoa flour from royal quinoa, a variety grown in Bolivia that is exceptionally high in protein. The spaghetti takes a good 15 minutes to cook, but the macaroni only takes six to seven minutes. It makes a good choice for dishes like <em style=""font-style: italic"">pasta e fagiole</em> (recipe below), because it won&#8217;t become soggy.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Brown rice pasta</span>: I use the house brand from my local Trader Joe&#8217;s, but it&#8217;s no different from other brands. The brown rice fusilli takes about nine minutes to cook and resembles regular pasta in feel and flavor.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Papadini pasta</span>: Available online at <a href=""http://www.eatitworld.com/"">Eatitworld.com</a>, this pasta is made from flours ground from urad legumes, such as green lentils and mung beans.

Usually I stick with my black-eyed peas salad. But I've always been curious about how people in other countries usher in the New Year.</p>
<p>Lentils and raisins are present on Italian tables because they resemble coins and swell when cooked. They're usually accompanied by pork, a symbol of prosperity and abundance. In other parts of the world, different beans stand in for lentils - chickpeas in Provence, black-eyed peas in the American South - also because they're small and round like coins, and expand when they cook.</p>
<p>Greens - spinach, collards, kale and cabbage - symbolize money (think greenbacks) and growth. Other foods that represent good fortune in the coming year include rice, golden foods like cornbread and saffron, and baked goods shaped like rings (often a coin is hidden inside).</p>
<p>Often sweets are eaten so that the year will be, yes, sweet.

Sometimes sheer will power is all that is required to contend with the party platters, nut bowls and cookie plates you encounter at holiday get-togethers. But it also helps if you're not too hungry when you arrive at those parties, so that you don't head straight for the processed (read: high-fat and salty) snacks that are everywhere you look. Remember to eat lunch, and if you're still feeling peckish before you set out, grab something that has a lot of fiber, like a generous serving of crudit&#233;s.</p>

Soups, stews and casseroles all fall into this category: you can make them at any time of day or night, so they'll be on hand when people are ready to eat.</p>

But by shunning all types, we do ourselves a disservice.Some fats, mostly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids from plant sources, do not have an adverse effect on health if consumed judiciously - just the contrary.

Marcos might be in difficulty, as he came under criticism from the Philippines' leading clergyman and worries grew about the state of his health. Opposition newspapers carried detailed reports today about an incident Thursday in which Mr. Marcos, who appeared exhausted and apparently was bleeding from his hands, received medical care on the stage of a rally at Dagupan, north of Manila.

But a growing number of local governments are trying to curb the very thing that gives country air a romantic aura: wood smoke. Wood smoke is a major cause of air pollution in dozens of towns, primarily in the West, where local weather conditions prevent the smoke from dissipating.

Aspartame, approved two years ago as a lowcalorie sweetener for such dry foods as drink mixes, breakfast cereals and chewing gum, was released for use in by far the largest market for sugar substitutes: diet carbonated soft drinks. The investment in this product by its developer, G.D. Searle & Company, has been great, but the potential return on the investment is much, much greater. Searle's tabletop aspartame sweetener, Equal, has already surpassed in dollar sales its leading competitor, Sweet 'n Low, a saccharin-based product that had had the field to itself since the banning of cyclamates 13 years ago. With a taste that is indistinguishable from sugar but without the bitter aftertaste left by saccharin, aspartame is expected to win a large share of the softdrink market. And a huge market it is. Every year, Americans consume 40 gallons (the equivalent of more than 400 12-ounce cans) of soda pop for every man, woman and child in the country. For teen-agers, average consumption is more than double that figure.
