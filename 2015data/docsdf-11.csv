He was 87. Bernard Pollara was born on July 28, 1927 in Chicago, IL to Sicilian immigrants Giuseppe and Dominica Pollara. He served as a Hospital Corpman in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1946. Under the G.I. Bill, he earned a BS in Chemistry from Northwestern University (1951) and an MS in Chemistry from the University of Illinois (1954). He went on to receive an MD (1960) and a PhD in Biochemistry (1963) from the University of Minnesota, where he did his Pediatric Residency and Immunology Fellowship. In 1969, he moved with his family to Albany, NY to head up the New York State Health Department's Kidney Disease Institute while also teaching pediatrics at Albany Medical College. In 1979, he became Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at Albany Med, where he remained until 1994. He moved to Tampa, FL to become the John E. and Aliese Price Professor of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at the University of South Florida (USF) College of Medicine where he served as Division Chief, Medical Director, and Interim Chair, retiring reluctantly in 2010 when his health began to fail. Dr. Pollara had extensive expertise in immunology, having trained with the world-renowned Dr. Robert A. Good at the University of Minnesota. He led USF Pediatrics' clinical research initiatives and headed dozens of studies related to the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines. Dr. Pollara was very dedicated to the training of medical students and residents and to faculty development, and was awarded federal grants that supported his initiatives in these areas. Among his many distinctions, he was awarded the Academic Laureate while at Albany Medical College. This year, USF honored Dr. Pollara with the establishment of the annual Bernard Pollara Resident Lectureship. He founded the Children's Hospital at Albany Medical Center and was dedicated to the care of children, particularly those in underserved communities. As an officer in the US Public Health Service Reserve, he worked as a visiting physician for the Navajo Indian Health Service in New Mexico and Arizona, the Migrant Farm Workers Clinic in Washington State, and the Black Feet Community Hospital in Montana. In 1992/1993, he spent a sabbatical in Bethel, Alaska as a staff pediatrician at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Regional Health Corporation venturing out into remote areas to attend to the first nation peoples, many of whom had never seen a doctor of western medicine. He was a gourmet chef who loved traveling the world, fly-fishing, betting on football games, and eating pie. He loved spending time with his family and was thrilled to see his grandchildren thrive. He will be dearly missed. Dr. Pollara is survived by his wife Jeannette Fleischer, his five children and six grandchildren: Dominique (Kurt Rosen), Sacramento, CA; Lia Friel (Jack) daughters Shelby and Christina, Weston, MA; Gina son Bernard, NYC; Julia Riggin (Ray) son Rayce, Wheatridge, CO; and Joseph (Gwen) son Luca, daughter Maya; as well as his sister Anna Schmidt, Chicago, IL; and his first wife, Joanne Pollara, Albany, NY.

164,,2015-05-15,article,"Paid Notice: Deaths  POLLARA, BERNARD",555fed9d79881050becdd819,Classified,"POLLARA--Bernard, MD, PHD, died peacefully in his sleep after succumbing to bladder cancer on May 10, 2015 at his home in Tampa, FL with his devoted wife, Jeannette, and youngest daughter, Julia (who he delivered at birth) at his side. He was 87. Bernard Pollara was born on July 28, 1927 in Chicago, IL to Sicilian immigrants Giuseppe and Dominica Pollara. He served as a Hospital Corpman in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1946. Under the G.I. Bill, he earned a BS in Chemistry from Northwestern University (1951) and an MS in Chemistry from the University of Illinois (1954). He went on to receive an MD (1960) and a PhD in Biochemistry (1963) from the University of Minnesota, where he did his Pediatric Residency and Immunology Fellowship. In 1969, he moved with his family to Albany, NY to head up the New York State Health Department's Kidney Disease Institute while also teaching pediatrics at Albany Medical College. In 1979, he became Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at Albany Med, where he remained until 1994. He moved to Tampa, FL to become the John E. and Aliese Price Professor of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at the University of South Florida (USF) College of Medicine where he served as Division Chief, Medical Director, and Interim Chair, retiring reluctantly in 2010 when his health began to fail. Dr. Pollara had extensive expertise in immunology, having trained with the world-renowned Dr. Robert A. Good at the University of Minnesota. He led USF Pediatrics' clinical research initiatives and headed dozens of studies related to the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines. Dr. Pollara was very dedicated to the training of medical students and residents and to faculty development, and was awarded federal grants that supported his initiatives in these areas. Among his many distinctions, he was awarded the Academic Laureate while at Albany Medical College. This year, USF honored Dr. Pollara with the establishment of the annual Bernard Pollara Resident Lectureship. He founded the Children's Hospital at Albany Medical Center and was dedicated to the care of children, particularly those in underserved communities. As an officer in the US Public Health Service Reserve, he worked as a visiting physician for the Navajo Indian Health Service in New Mexico and Arizona, the Migrant Farm Workers Clinic in Washington State, and the Black Feet Community Hospital in Montana. In 1992/1993, he spent a sabbatical in Bethel, Alaska as a staff pediatrician at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Regional Health Corporation venturing out into remote areas to attend to the first nation peoples, many of whom had never seen a doctor of western medicine. He was a gourmet chef who loved traveling the world, fly-fishing, betting on football games, and eating pie. He loved spending time with his family and was thrilled to see his grandchildren thrive. He will be dearly missed. Dr. Pollara is survived by his wife Jeannette Fleischer, his five children and six grandchildren: Dominique (Kurt Rosen), Sacramento, CA; Lia Friel (Jack) daughters Shelby and Christina, Weston, MA; Gina son Bernard, NYC; Julia Riggin (Ray) son Rayce, Wheatridge, CO; and Joseph (Gwen) son Luca, daughter Maya; as well as his sister Anna Schmidt, Chicago, IL; and his first wife, Joanne Pollara, Albany, NY. A funeral mass will be held on Saturday, May 16, 2015 at 11am at Christ the King Church (821 S. Dale Mabry Highway, Tampa, Florida). He will be interred at the Calvary Catholic Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Bernard Pollara, M.D, PhD Resident Lectureship at University of South Florida Department of Pediatrics.

Loving husband of Joan, brother of Paula Oreck, father of Susan (Jonathan Bram) and Elizabeth (Andrew Cohen) and adoring grandfather of Nathan, Lily, Henry, Julia and Jenny. Arthur was a proud 1949 graduate of The Fieldston School, was surely its longest serving trustee, and maintained cherished lifelong friendships with many of his classmates. Both of his daughters and all five grandchildren continued his legacy there. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1953, where he was a long serving trustee and permanent class president. As was his way, he made many wonderful friends at Hopkins, through whom he ultimately met his bride, Joannie Goldberg of Charleston, SC, a Goucher graduate. From 1954-57, he served in the United States Army Security Agency in Tokyo and was awarded the Commendation Ribbon for Meritorious Achievement. Arthur was the president of Bruno Appliance Corporation, a distribution business started by his father, Irving, which was for many years the country's largest distributor of RCA and Whirlpool appliances. Arthur was a trustee of Beth Israel Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners for many decades. Arthur loved tradition and often joked that he was never one for change, choosing to spend 80 of his 84 years in the same Central Park West apartment. He was president of the Kenilworth's co-op board for many years. Throughout his illness, the dinners he shared with a group of special neighbors were true highlights. Arthur was the youngest child in a large extended family and his pride in his uncle General David Sarnoff's accomplishments was well known. He was thrilled to preside over the enormous and wonderful Sarnoff family Thanksgiving at his home in Yorktown Heights for many years. Arthur also truly embraced Joan's colorful southern family and was in turn embraced by the Dumas clan. In 1978 the couple purchased a home on South Carolina's Sullivan's Island and spent happy summers on the beach surrounded by multiple generations. The annual Shabbat dinners they hosted there were loud and delicious and are cherished memories of their loving extended family. Family legend maintains that Arthur was the first season ticket holder at the new Madison Square Garden, cheering the Knicks to their two championships with an enthusiasm he would later bring to his grandchildren's endless parade of sports games, concerts and the Fieldston fashion show. Arthur was kind and generous to so many people who passed through his life, maintaining meaningful relationships with classmates, neighbors, distant cousins, old army buddies and many of his children's friends and classmates. He was truly loved and he will be missed.

Loving husband of Joan, brother of Paula Oreck, father of Susan (Jonathan Bram) and Elizabeth (Andrew Cohen) and adoring grandfather of Nathan, Lily, Henry, Julia and Jenny. Arthur was a proud 1949 graduate of The Fieldston School, was surely its longest serving trustee, and maintained cherished lifelong friendships with many of his classmates. Both of his daughters and all five grandchildren continued his legacy there. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1953, where he was a long serving trustee and permanent class president. As was his way, he made many wonderful friends at Hopkins, through whom he ultimately met his bride, Joannie Goldberg of Charleston, SC, a Goucher graduate. From 1954-57, he served in the United States Army Security Agency in Tokyo and was awarded the Commendation Ribbon for Meritorious Achievement. Arthur was the president of Bruno Appliance Corporation, a distribution business started by his father, Irving, which was for many years the country's largest distributor of RCA and Whirlpool appliances. Arthur was a trustee of Beth Israel Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners for many decades. Arthur loved tradition and often joked that he was never one for change, choosing to spend 80 of his 84 years in the same Central Park West apartment. He was president of the Kenilworth's co-op board for many years. Throughout his illness, the dinners he shared with a group of special neighbors were true highlights. Arthur was the youngest child in a large extended family and his pride in his uncle General David Sarnoff's accomplishments was well known. He was thrilled to preside over the enormous and wonderful Sarnoff family Thanksgiving at his home in Yorktown Heights for many years. Arthur also truly embraced Joan's colorful southern family and was in turn embraced by the Dumas clan. In 1978 the couple purchased a home on South Carolina's Sullivan's Island and spent happy summers on the beach surrounded by multiple generations. The annual Shabbat dinners they hosted there were loud and delicious and are cherished memories of their loving extended family. Family legend maintains that Arthur was the first season ticket holder at the new Madison Square Garden, cheering the Knicks to their two championships with an enthusiasm he would later bring to his grandchildren's endless parade of sports games, concerts and the Fieldston fashion show. Arthur was kind and generous to so many people who passed through his life, maintaining meaningful relationships with classmates, neighbors, distant cousins, old army buddies and many of his children's friends and classmates. He was truly loved and he will be missed.

Just short of 90 years of age, John remained active and engaging. He was looking forward with great anticipation to the soon arrival of his family for what he said would be our last get- together. So although his family grieves that he is gone, we take solace that he died while in a happy state and still out and about in the city he so loved. He has been a loyal and contented resident of Manhattan and thought it, indeed, knew it to be the greatest city in the world. John was born in Independence, Wisconsin in 1926. He grew up in this small, rural farming village with his parents and sister. Independence always held a cherished place in his heart, but in his senior year of high school, he was called into the US Navy during war times. After serving until 1947, he then attended the University of Minnesota where he studied art and architecture. Graduating in 1952, he began work in Minneapolis at the Dayton Company. In 1954, he moved to New York City. Once there he was first associated with the Wayah Gallery on 4th Avenue. Encouraged by Mr. Wayah and with the confidence and the initial financial backing of his parents, John ventured out into what would become his profession and went to Europe in 1956 for his first art buying trip. His chosen profession proved ideal for his temperament and critical eye. He never stopped working, loving art, and enjoying people from all over the world who shared his enthusiasm for the arts and the artist behind the creative enterprise. John was a world traveller and always keenly aware of his surroundings and the beauty that a discerning eye could discover. He became schooled in art, music, and architecture without ever losing his love and passion for these artistic forms. He was well known and respected by his peers and clients within the art community. He also supported many fine museums, galleries, and institutions of art and music, especially those in his beloved city, notably The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, The Morgan Library, The Frick, The Mannes School of Music, and The Julliard School of Music. We know there are many more that should be mentioned. He had friends from all over the world, and all who knew him would agree that our world has lost a very keen eye and provocative mind. John had the unique proclivity of becoming important to the many people whose lives he touched. Primarily because he sought to appreciate each persons's individuality, while at the same time probing to understand, he became significant to each of us. He guarded zealously his own freedom of mind and because of this, chose to remain somewhat anonymous and always independent. He loved children and treasured the pictures made for him by those of a dear friend when he was in the hospital five years ago recovering from a traumatic brain injury. He wanted to be alive in this world only as long as he remained vital. He was never self indulgent, but he certainly enjoyed good food at the places that he frequented. He was a man of routines. And he had many special friends with whom he engaged regularly for meals and events and social occasions. He was friendly, warm, generous, charming, clever, funny, and witty and became special even to strangers, if given a chance to interact. John had to be shared among many people, but he didn't mind. Smile. One friend once said of him, he makes more use of New York City for what it has to offer in the arts than any other person I know. That could also be said of his ability to challenge each of us to see differently and think more deeply. Being a successful art dealer, he also contributed to the financial success of others. But more than anything, he wanted each of us to enter into the visual world he experienced. The art world has lost a great ally, and we have lost a good friend. He will be missed. He is survived by his beloved sister, Patricia (Boyd), and her children whom he adopted as his own -- his nieces, Carol and Cathy, and his nephews, William and Matthew. John opened his home to his extended family and never tired of showing them New York's greatness, as well as its not so easily discovered treasures. We were all blessed to have known him. Family and close friends will gather to celebrate his life in the city he cherished and then return his ashes to Wisconsin to be buried beside his father Archie and his mother Caroline. In lieu of flowers, he can be remembered by a gift in his name to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br><br>

Billy lived a big life, being born to parents late in life who adored their only son, and older sisters who surrounded him with love. His personality, good looks and intellect carried him far in life. Billy lived life his way, all the time, even in his last years when confronted with trial and tribulation. Billy struck out to make his own life at the tender age of 19, after the death of his father. He made his own way in life, finding a place to live near the ocean that he loved. Billy put himself through school and had a goal for his future; a goal that he fully achieved. Billy built his business empire ""brick by brick"" and attained all that he desired in life. Billy was a shrewd businessman and built his business on the premise of a strong will and hard work. In the end, his strength and will sustained him when doctors and nurses questioned his ability to maintain life through such a debilitating illness. Billy was a Financial Planning Specialist and Managing Director, Wealth Management of Morgan Stanley Financial Group in Boca Raton, Florida. He has been honored in the financial world many times, most recently in Forbes Magazine maintaining his high business standards, knowledge and expertise even through the worst of times. It was this work that Billy thrived on and he was regarded in high esteem by his clients and colleagues alike for his business expertise both nationally and internationally in the financial world. Billy lived a full and blessed life with his beautiful and loving wife, Jocelyn Canning Calabretta, who cared for him to the very end. Jocelyn's love for her husband was beautiful to behold and a blessing to him during the dark days of his illness. Jocelyn lived true to her vow ""in sickness and in health"" and cared and nurtured Billy through the worst of times. Billy's family was devoted to him from his first cry to his last breath. Billy was a life force that drew people to him and he enjoyed the friendship of many. Son, brother, husband, nephew, uncle, Godfather, friend? Billy was and will always be surrounded by love. Billy leaves behind to love him and honor his memory, his wife Jocelyn Canning Calabretta, sister and brother-in-law, Deborah and Randy Renner of Delray Beach, Florida, sister and brother-in-law Connie and Kevin Brogan, of St. Simons Island, Georgia, nephews, Jeff Oliverio of Hollywood, Florida and Gabe Oliverio of Delray Beach, Florida, niece and husband, Jessica Windon Callaghan and Nick Callaghan of St. Augustine, Florida, three great nephews, Jackson and Liam Callaghan and Michael Oliverio and many loving cousins in West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and North Carolina.

Billy lived a big life, being born to parents late in life who adored their only son, and older sisters who surrounded him with love. His personality, good looks and intellect carried him far in life. Billy lived life his way, all the time, even in his last years when confronted with trial and tribulation. Billy struck out to make his own life at the tender age of 19, after the death of his father. He made his own way in life, finding a place to live near the ocean that he loved. Billy put himself through school and had a goal for his future; a goal that he fully achieved. Billy built his business empire ""brick by brick"" and attained all that he desired in life. Billy was a shrewd businessman and built his business on the premise of a strong will and hard work. In the end, his strength and will sustained him when doctors and nurses questioned his ability to maintain life through such a debilitating illness. Billy was a Financial Planning Specialist and Managing Director, Wealth Management of Morgan Stanley Financial Group in Boca Raton, Florida. He has been honored in the financial world many times, most recently in Forbes Magazine maintaining his high business standards, knowledge and expertise even through the worst of times. It was this work that Billy thrived on and he was regarded in high esteem by his clients and colleagues alike for his business expertise both nationally and internationally in the financial world. Billy lived a full and blessed life with his beautiful and loving wife, Jocelyn Canning Calabretta, who cared for him to the very end. Jocelyn's love for her husband was beautiful to behold and a blessing to him during the dark days of his illness. Jocelyn lived true to her vow ""in sickness and in health"" and cared and nurtured Billy through the worst of times. Billy's family was devoted to him from his first cry to his last breath. Billy was a life force that drew people to him and he enjoyed the friendship of many. Son, brother, husband, nephew, uncle, Godfather, friend? Billy was and will always be surrounded by love. Billy leaves behind to love him and honor his memory, his wife Jocelyn Canning Calabretta, sister and brother-in-law, Deborah and Randy Renner of Delray Beach, Florida, sister and brother-in-law Connie and Kevin Brogan, of St. Simons Island, Georgia, nephews, Jeff Oliverio of Hollywood, Florida and Gabe Oliverio of Delray Beach, Florida, niece and husband, Jessica Windon Callaghan and Nick Callaghan of St. Augustine, Florida, three great nephews, Jackson and Liam Callaghan and Michael Oliverio and many loving cousins in West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and North Carolina.
