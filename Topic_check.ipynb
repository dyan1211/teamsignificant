About a third of all sexually active adults in Botswana and South Africa carry H.I.V., a rate nearly 10 times higher than almost anywhere in the world outside Africa. These prevention efforts have been sensible -- abstaining from sex or using condoms consistently do prevent H.I.V. infection -- but their effects have been disappointing. There is another way to reduce the spread of H.I.V. -- one that is increasingly recognized by public-health experts but that has been relegated, thus far, to an afterthought: fidelity -- either in marriage or in a committed relationship. As experts come to understand more about the African AIDS epidemic, it seems clear that regular sexual contact with more than one person is the key human behavior that enables the rapid spread of H.I.V. Since 2002, international organizations have promoted an approach called ''A.B.C.,'' which stands for abstain, be faithful, use condoms. But the ''be faithful'' part has largely fallen through the cracks, and that may well have undermined efforts to fight the epidemic.
