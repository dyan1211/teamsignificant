She was born in Brooklyn, NY on September 25, 1948 to Bertha (Rothfeld) Goldberg and Theodore Goldberg. Following graduation from Brooklyn College, Marilyn worked as a buyer for the Ohrbachs chain of department stores. Marilyn and her loving husband of 43 years, Mark, raised their three children (Susan Swinkin, David, and Daniel) in Stony Brook, NY with love and whimsy. Over the years, Marilyn created many fun-filled, unforgettable experiences for their children including annual pumpkin picking trips, Halloween and April Fool's Day dinners. She created a large backyard garden that was like a slow-motion explosion of color during warmer months. After focusing on raising their children for many years, Marilyn returned to school to become a registered nurse. She worked as an RN at the SUNY Stony Brook Hospital for three years, followed by 10 years at the University's Student Health Center. Marilyn was extraordinarily kind and giving; people who considered her a true and trusted friend are too numerous to count. She would safely escort insects outside of her home rather than see them harmed. The joie de vivre she exuded was contagious. She loved to dance, adding to the merriment of many celebrations by doing so. Words cannot express the deep sense of loss experienced by Marilyn's family and friends. Marilyn is survived by her husband, their three children, granddaughter Alison Swinkin, son- in-law Robert Swinkin, daughter-in-law Anne Siegler, sisters Carol Buxbaum and Barbara Shostak, and mother-in- law Ruth Stolzberg.<br><br>

Diagnosed with breast cancer in 1986, Naomi won her 28-year battle with the disease in resounding fashion by surviving to witness the most treasured milestones of her life, most notably her 50th wedding anniversary in 2014 and the birth of her 3 cherished grandchildren, including her long-awaited granddaughter born just last month. While her health was at times defined by disease, her life was defined by her deep and constant love of her family and friends, and their joyful love and admiration of her. She relished in her multi-faceted role as connector of loved ones, fearless friend, provider of comfort, support, and optimism, doting mother and grandmother, and pusher of food. Born in Brooklyn, NY on April 12, 1940, Naomi was a life-long New Yorker who often joked that Bloomingdale's was her summer home. She was graduated from Connecticut College in 1961 and worked as an encyclopedia editor before choosing to raise her family. Even so, her work was never done and she went on to co-author 2 books: Where Women Stand, with Ann Levine (Random House, 1997) and Recipes for Our Daughters, with Cynthia Rothstein (Ballantine Books, 2004). Naomi is survived by her husband of 50 years, David, her children, Michael and Debbie (Michael Norkin), her grandchildren, Theo, Luke, and Josie, her brother Stephen Silver (Margot), and her nieces, Amy Bigler (Ron) and Kate Silver. Funeral services for Naomi will held on Thursday, February 5 at 1pm at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY 10024.

Born in Brooklyn, August 28, 1929, died in her Manhattan home on January 31, 2015. Educated in Catholic schools, she further received a BS degree from Queens College, and a MS in Social Work from Columbia University. A Social Worker for many years, she championed the rights of children, incarcerated women, and ex-offenders. Many social programs throughout New York City benefit today from Barbara's relentless efforts and skillful fundraising. She retired in 2011 at the age of 82 from West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH) after twenty-one years as the Director of Development. Barbara had a progressive spirit and was particularly talented at organization, preparation and inclusiveness, tempered by spontaneity and a zeal for having fun. Barbara's talents shone in her position as Director of Community Liaison in the Office of the New York City Council President (1977-1979). They also led to her successes in acquiring funding and grants for many service agencies: Project Green Hope (1980-1986) and the Fortune Society (1980-1986) as Development Director and Grants Administrator, both supportive services for ex-prisoners, male and female; the AIDS Services Delivery Consortium as Director (1987); and West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH), as Directory of Development (1980-2011).

Born in Brooklyn, August 28, 1929, died in her Manhattan home on January 31, 2015. Educated in Catholic schools, she further received a BS degree from Queens College, and a MS in Social Work from Columbia University. A Social Worker for many years, she championed the rights of children, incarcerated women, and ex-offenders. Many social programs throughout New York City benefit today from Barbara's relentless efforts and skillful fundraising. She retired in 2011 at the age of 82 from West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH) after twenty-one years as the Director of Development. Barbara had a progressive spirit and was particularly talented at organization, preparation and inclusiveness, tempered by spontaneity and a zeal for having fun. Barbara's talents shone in her position as Director of Community Liaison in the Office of the New York City Council President (1977-1979). They also led to her successes in acquiring funding and grants for many service agencies: Project Green Hope (1980-1986) and the Fortune Society (1980-1986) as Development Director and Grants Administrator, both supportive services for ex-prisoners, male and female; the AIDS Services Delivery Consortium as Director (1987); and West Side Federation for Senior Housing and Support Services (WSFSSH), as Directory of Development (1980-2011). Up until her last illness, Barbara for many years co-chaired the Community Board Number Seven, Committee for Health and Human Services.
