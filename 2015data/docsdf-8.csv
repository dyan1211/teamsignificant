After a long career helping African-Americans fight for fairness and justice, philanthropic consultant Elizabeth Hicks died in Manhattan on May 14, 2015. She was 92. Ms. Hicks, educated at Hunter College and an early Urban League member, worked for some time as an executive at the notable Harold L. Oram public relations firm, among the major fundraisers for the humanitarian and environmental causes of the time. Her notes to and from Mr. Oram with her ideas for innovative fundraising campaigns have been preserved among the Oram Papers in the Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) library. She went on to raise funds for the United Negro College Fund, especially Meharry Medical College. She was directly responsible, thereby, for giving many minority students the opportunity to get a college education. Before her retirement, she also raised funds for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Another of her outstanding accomplishments was helping an interested group form a fundraising LDF branch in Princeton, NJ. Ms. Hicks was born in Harrison, rural Georgia, on October 27, 1922 to the late Thomas Hicks and Lillie Hicks. Her family joined the South-to-North migration of those people of color who had the boldness and the means to avoid the cruelty of segregationist Jim Crow laws and so she grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens, and was educated there. She was a tireless supporter of the formal arts and would never fail to remind friends and associates with similar interests to meet her at performances on Broadway, or at Lincoln Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), St. Thomas (Episcopalian) Church, or the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and at exhibitions in favorite art galleries. She eventually succumbed to the usual circulatory problems of aging, but kept her ready sense of humor and her charming concern for the well-being of her friends and relatives as she struggled with failing health. She is survived by her cousin Viola Lena Doswell of Babylon, NY, and by the people she mentored, as well as by her close friends and her longtime caregivers.

Ms. Hicks was born in Harrison, rural Georgia, on October 27, 1922 to the late Thomas Hicks and Lillie Hicks. Her family joined the South-to-North migration of those people of color who had the boldness and the means to avoid the cruelty of segregationist Jim Crow laws and so she grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens, and was educated there. She was a tireless supporter of the formal arts and would never fail to remind friends and associates with similar interests to meet her at performances on Broadway, or at Lincoln Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), St. Thomas (Episcopalian) Church, or the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and at exhibitions in favorite art galleries. She eventually succumbed to the usual circulatory problems of aging, but kept her ready sense of humor and her charming concern for the well-being of her friends and relatives as she struggled with failing health. She is survived by her cousin Viola Lena Doswell of Babylon, NY, and by the people she mentored, as well as by her close friends and her longtime caregivers.

Loop M.D. Former CEO and chairman of Cleveland Clinic, passed away June 11. Dr. Loop served as chairman and CEO of Cleveland Clinic from 1989 to 2004. He was a pioneering cardiac surgeon and former chairman of the Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. Under his leadership, Cleveland Clinic became an integrated regional healthcare delivery system, with an expanded main campus, hospital and clinic in Florida, and its own medical school program. He launched construction of what would become the Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Pavilion and Glickman Tower, and established a sound foundation for Cleveland Clinic's growth in the current century. ""The legacy of Dr. Loop is all around us,"" says Toby Cosgrove, MD, current president and CEO of Cleveland Clinic. ""We can never forget all he's done to make Cleveland Clinic one of the world's great medical centers."" Known to friends and colleagues as ""Fred"", Dr. Loop was the son of a country doctor from Lafayette, Indiana. He graduated from Purdue University, Indiana, and earned his medical degree at The George Washington University, Washington, D.C. After post-graduate training at The George Washington University, the US Air Force at Andrews Air Force Base, and Cleveland Clinic, he joined Cleveland Clinic as a cardiac surgeon in 1970. He performed more than 12,000 cardiac surgeries, and was the author of 350 papers on all aspects of cardiovascular surgery. He refined arterial grafting, improved reoperative techniques, and confirmed the superiority of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery. He led comprehensive follow-up studies of bypass patients, and helped establish the world's first computerized registry of cardiac surgery outcome. In 1975, he was named chairman of the Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular surgery. Over the next 14 years, he consolidated Cleveland Clinic's worldwide reputation for excellence in cardiac surgery, and assembled a team of expert surgeons who would go on to lead their specialty and set the pace for years to come. Dr. Loop was named CEO in 1989. His challenges included declining reimbursement, potential competition from private hospital systems, and the need to preserve Cleveland Clinic's specialty focus amid a growing demand for primary services. He stabilized finances, centralized authority, and streamlined reporting relationships. His strategy to improve regional access resulted in the construction of family health ambulatory centers across Northeast Ohio, and the acquisition of eight community hospitals through the 1990s. At the same time, he invested heavily in information technology, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive electronic medical records system. With a leadership gift of $100 million from Alfred Lerner and family, he launched a philanthropic campaign that enabled the construction of the Lerner Research Institute, Cole Eye Institute, Taussig Cancer Center, and the Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. He improved access and added new operating rooms through the Maria and Sam Miller Emergency Services building. He reaffirmed commitment to Cleveland Clinic Florida, and built a new integrated medical campus in Weston, Florida. Programs and facilities founded under his leadership include the Sherwin Research Building, Children's Hospital, Cleveland Clinic Innovations, the Surgery Center, Neurological Imaging Center, Cleveland Clinic Sports Health, and the purchase and renovation of Foundation House. In 2001, Dr. Loop announced plans for the current Miller Family Pavilion to consolidate heart and vascular services at a single location. With modifications and the addition of the Glickman Tower, the new facility was completed under the administration of Dr. Cosgrove in 2008. Dr. Loop was married to Bernadine Healy, MD, (1944-2011), who served as chairman of the Research Institute from 1985 to 1995.
