# teamsignificant

Our clean code and project annotation is compiled in the [ProcessBook notebook](https://github.com/dyan1211/teamsignificant/blob/master/ProcessBook.ipynb)

All of the work was done in individual notebooks.  In the ProcessBook, we link to the individual notebooks for each section of the code, but note that these notebooks are working notebooks and not necessarily annotated or presentable code.  
The approximate order of the notebooks are:
