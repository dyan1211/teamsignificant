Mr. Anderson was born February 14, 1925 in Mansfield, OH, where he was the youngest Eagle Scout at the time in Ohio in the Boy Scouts of America. He graduated Miami of Ohio University in 1947 and received his Masters from Columbia Business School in 1949. He served as an officer in the United States Navy during World War II, where he was assigned to a mine sweeper ship in the Pacific fleet. After returning from the War, while at Columbia, he married the love of his life, Rose-Marie Garcia Anderson, who survives him. She is a graduate of Hunter College and from Astoria, NY. He was employed at accounting and financial positions at Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith, Inc.; American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Inc.; Time Inc.; W.R. Grace & Company, Inc.; McCall Corporation and Reliance Group, Inc. In 1970 he became president and then chairman of Hospital Affiliates International, Inc. When that company was acquired by INA Corporation, he became chairman of The INA Health Care Group, Inc. which owned and managed hospitals on five continents, as well as health maintenance organizations and nursing homes in the United States. The CIGNA health plan resulted from the 1982 combination of the INA Corporation and Connecticut General Life Insurance Company. In addition to his wife, Rose-Marie, Mr. Anderson's survivors include three children, Gail Canizares, Neil Anderson, and Barbara McDonald, 11 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. Mr. Anderson travelled and read broadly, which furthered his interest in education. In 1994 he and his wife established the Anderson Foundation primarily to support efforts to improve K-12 education in America. Since that time they devoted considerable time and effort in pursuing that goal. 1/3  ",Paid Death Notice

Rooney, Jr., the Chairman of H.H. Brown Shoe Company and the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Melville Corporation, died on March 24, 2015 at Greenwich Hospital. He was 93 years old. Rooney was married for 65 years to the love of his life, the former Frances Heffernan of Worcester, Massachusetts. One of the leading retail executives of his generation, Rooney transformed Melville Corporation from a shoe company with $180 million in revenue at the time he became chief executive officer at age 42 into a specialty retail business with over $7 billion of revenue at the time of his retirement in 1987. In 1987, Melville's businesses included Marshall's, Linens & Things, K.B. Toys and CVS Drug Stores. Today the company's name has changed from Melville Corp to CVS Health Corporation. In 1990, after three years of retirement, Rooney agreed to become CEO of H.H. Brown Shoe Co., Inc., which was owned by his late father-in -law. In 1991, the company was sold to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and at Warren Buffett?s request he became Chairman. In a press interview, Mr. Buffett concluded, Frank ""is a sensational human being and a great manager."" Throughout his adult life Rooney maintained a commitment to numerous civic, charitable and education causes. He was one of the founding trustees of the Inner City Scholarship Fund, which today provides over 30,000 inner city children with scholarships to attend Catholic schools in New York City. He also served as a trustee of United Cerebral Palsy; Greenwich Hospital; March of Dimes; Smithsonian Institute; Boys & Girls Club of America; St. Ignatius School in the Bronx; The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania; Pace University; and Fordham University. In 1987, Rooney received an honorary degree from Boston College. In addition, Rooney served on the Board of Directors of Bankers Trust Company; Collins & Aikman Textile Company; ADT; AMF Corporation; Black & Decker; Dunkin Donuts; and Neiman Markus. Frank Rooney was born at home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1921. He graduated in 1939 from North Brookfield High School where he was captain of the basketball team, and he received his bachelor degree from the University of Pennsylvania (Wharton School) in 1943. He graduated as an Ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve and was assigned that year to the battleship USS North Carolina in the Pacific. He was aboard as a gunnery officer in 10 major engagements between 1943 and 1945. He began his business career in 1946 as a sales trainee with the John Foote Shoe Company in Brockton, Massachusetts. Two years later, he went to work for the Florsheim Shoe Company in Chicago, and in 1953 he joined the Thom McAn Shoe Company, a subsidiary of Melville Shoe Corporation, as a buyer/ stylist. He rose to President of Thom McAn in 1961 and in 1964 he was elected Chairman, President and CEO of Melville Shoe Corporation. Mr. Rooney is survived by his beloved wife Frances Heffernan and eight children: Peter M. Rooney (Kathy) of Basking Ridge, NJ; Michael F. Rooney (Joann) of New Rochelle, NY; Stephen G.

Sr., It is with profound grief that we write about the passing of Mr. Eugene P. Conese, Sr., loving husband, adoring father, devoted son, brother a warm and giving friend that was willing to share his insights, advice and wisdom. Gene's life was one of dedication and love, and he positively impacted the lives of countless people during his life. There are no words to describe the enormous void he will leave behind in his family, his community, and his extensive circle of friends and associates. Gene began his new journey on Thursday, March 19th, 2015, peacefully in his sleep. He will be remembered for his great life stories which he wrote in his memoir, Making Memories - The Story of my Life. His dedication to his family ensured a strong bond between all generations. His legacy is his defining characteristics of integrity, loyalty and generosity. He leaves behind his wife of 60 years, Anna May, and his two daughters and two sons and their spouses, Deborah and Jim Eagan, Susan and Peter Metzger, Eugene and Marianne Conese, Jr., Mark and Cynthia Conese; his ten grandchildren and their spouses, Amanda (Metzger) and Matt DeSocio, Melissa (Metzger) and Steve Finkelstein, Jeffrey Metzger, Kendall Eagan, Meredith Eagan, Conor Eagan, Caroline Conese, Jaqueline (Conese) and Matt Johnson, Christine Conese, Katherine Conese; and two great grandchildren, Ella and Jordan DeSocio.

In 1992, in recognition of Mr. Coneses Outstanding Achievement as an Entrepreneur, he was awarded the Iona College Alumni Association's Brother Arthur A. Loftus Award. He has served with distinction and commitment as a member of the board of trustees and contributing generously to both the Vision into Reality and Visions of Excellence capital campaigns. In 2001, Iona conferred on Mr. Conese the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters. In recognition of Mr. Conese's service and contributions to Iona College over the years, in 2008 its principal student dormitory was named after him and is now and forever known as Conese Hall. Eugene P. Conese, Sr. was the founder, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Greenwich Air Services, Inc. until its sale to General Electric in 1997. Under Gene's leadership it became the world's largest independent jet engine overhaul and rebuilding service company as well as one of the world's largest business and regional aircraft ground maintenance, parts and engine repair companies.
