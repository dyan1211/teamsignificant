Mrs. Ogilvie was a Director of Harcourt Brace & Co. and was honored for her service in 1960. Mrs. Ogilvie was a very generous and much admired philanthropist, supporting many causes, most notably the Stamford Hospital, Girls Inc., and Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Mass, from which she graduated in 1930. For many years, starting in the late 1940's, she volunteered her time at Stamford Hospital, accumulating over 9,000 volunteer hours in her lifetime. She has served as Trustee of the Hospital, Director of the Hospital Foundation and President of the Auxiliary. She made many important financial gifts to the hospital, donating the Brace Auditorium in the hospital in honor of her father, the Donna Brace Ogilvie Auditorium at the Tully Health Center and the establishment of the upcoming Donna Brace Ogilvie Volunteer Resource Center in the expanded hospital. She was honored at a special dinner in May of 2015 for her generosity to the hospital over the years, where it was stated that other than the founding benefactor of the hospital, ""no single individual has played a more important role in the history of Stamford Hospital."" She served on the board of the Stamford Girls Club during the 50's and 60's. She also served as Chair of the national board of Girls, Inc., based in New York City, for many years and at her death was still active as Distinguished Board Chair as well as serving on the board of the local Girls Inc. chapter in Sarasota, FL.

According to the school, ""Ogilvie is known as the most prominent female benefactor in the history of the school."" In 1997, Andover bestowed on her its highest honor, the Claude Moore Fuess Award. Her active philanthropic life earned her many other awards, honors and friendships that sustained her until her death. She was predeceased by her parents and her sister, Katharine Brace Cummings and three husbands, John Ralph Latham, Louis Francis Kroeck and Dr. John Black Ogilvie, a well- known surgeon practicing in Stamford.
