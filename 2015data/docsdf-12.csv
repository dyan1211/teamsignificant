The staff and trustees of the North Shore-LIJ Health System mourn the loss of John ""Jack"" S.T. Gallagher, the health system's founding president and chief executive officer. Jack died suddenly Saturday night, April 18, of a heart attack at his home in Palm Beach, FL. He was 83. Jack was a legendary leader whose foresight and vision as president and CEO of North Shore University Hospital (NSUH) in Manhasset laid the groundwork in the early 1990s for hospital mergers on Long Island and Queens, creating a model for the integrated health systems that are so prevalent in today's healthcare market. During an era when managed care was first taking hold and hospitals were struggling financially, Jack sought to level the playing field for healthcare providers. He negotiated a merger with what was then known as Community Hospital at Glen Cove in 1990, before formally establishing the North Shore Health System in 1992. Over the next four years, he would develop relationships with Huntington, Plainview, Franklin, Forest Hills, Syosset, Staten Island University and Southside hospitals, before the network expanded further with the 1997 merger with Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Medical Center. The historic merger created the North Shore-LIJ Health System that stands today as the largest in New York State and the nation's 11th largest non-profit health system. A Queens native who obtained a business degree from Holy Cross College, Jack left the family tire business in his early 30s to begin pursuing a career in healthcare administration, earning a master of science degree from Yale University in epidemiology and public health. He joined the administrative staff at what was then called North Shore Hospital as an intern in 1963, working for then-Executive Vice President and CEO Dennis Buckley. The two would work closely together over the next two decades before Jack became president and CEO in the 1980s - a job he would hold until his retirement at the end of 2000. He had continued to serve as a life trustee of the health system. In addition to his unparalleled dedication and commitment to his work, Jack was extremely affable and approachable, enjoying coffee and breakfast with front-line staff and playing the piano at hospital holiday parties and other gatherings. On behalf of the staff and trustees of the entire North Shore-LIJ Health System, we extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Aileen O'Halloran Gallagher; sons John, Robert, Thomas and Paul; daughters Grace Haggerty and Louise Grecco; seven step-children; 27 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

We are deeply saddened to announce that John S.T. Gallagher passed away peacefully at his home in Palm Beach on Saturday, April 18. He was born on December 9, 1931, in Jackson Heights, New York of Mercedes Wright Gallagher and Thomas Gallagher, Sr. He attended Xavier High School and graduated with a BS in Business Administration from Holy Cross College and a Masters of Science, Epidemiology and Public Health from Yale University. As a great visionary with a caring heart, he embarked on his career in the health care industry and, as he would say, ""gave birth"" to the North Shore Health System. Ultimately, as Chief Executive of the North Shore-LIJ Health System, John Gallagher did more than any single individual to mold the Long Island hospital market, as referenced in the Newsday article ""100 Who Shaped a Century"". After changing careers in his 30s, leaving the family tire business to study public health at Yale University, the Queens native had been driven by a vision of a superior health care system that would not only survive the assault of profit-driven managed care companies but thrive and deliver charity care to the poor as well. Gallagher, a workaholic with an affable nature, joined the administrative staff at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset in 1963 as an intern. He was appointed Executive Vice President in 1982. In the 1990s, when managed care started making inroads into New York, Gallagher began hatching a plan to develop an integrated health care system, joining multiple hospitals and care facilities that could span a broad geographic area, achieve economies of scale and, most important, be able to exercise muscle in rate negotiations with insurance companies and HMOs. More recently, he merged the North Shore Health System with the Long Island Jewish Medical Center to create the North Shore-LIJ Health System, a powerhouse of 18 hospitals and numerous outpatient centers that stretches from Suffolk to Staten Island. It is no exaggeration to say that Jack Gallagher's vision is one of the reasons that the North Shore-LIJ Health System exists today. After his retirement, he remained active, serving on many boards. When Jack was not playing the piano or painting, he would be on the water enjoying his boat. He is survived by his wife, Aileen O'Halloran Gallagher, six children: John, Grace, Robert, Louise, Thomas and Paul, seven stepchildren, 27 grandchildren and four greatgrandchildren. For his friendship, for his wisdom, for his deep sense of caring, he will be missed. Visitation will be at Oyster Bay Funeral Home on Thursday, April 23 from 3-5pm and 7-9pm.
