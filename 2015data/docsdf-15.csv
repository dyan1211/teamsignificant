President Emeritus of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, died February 24, 2015 at the age of 77. The cause of his death was a brain tumor, his wife said. He was born July 20, 1937 in Burlington, VT to Italian immigrants. He spent his youth in Barre, VT and went on to the University of Vermont in Burlington, earning a B.S. in 1959 and graduating from the UVM Medical School summa cum laude in 1963. His internship years were spent at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. His research career, which he began in Vermont with Dr. Thomas Tomasi, continued at the National Institutes of Health with Dr. Alan Peterkofsky. In 1967 he returned to NYC for a two year guest investigatorship with Dr. Henry Kunkel at the Rockefeller University. He then joined the first faculty of Mt. Sinai Medical School and continued there until 1974. At that time he joined the University of Texas Health Science Center in Dallas, TX as a full professor and then proceeded to do some of his most important work in antibody research, laying the foundation for the field of monoclonal antibody therapy in a number of human diseases. At age 60 he was asked to be the president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in Oklahoma City, OK, a non-profit medical research institution. He felt that this was the challenge of his lifetime, and during his nine year tenure he doubled the size of the institute and increased its NIH funding from $8 million to $27 million. For the last eight years of his life he consulted for universities and large and small pharmaceutical firms. In 1958 Don married Patricia Hollister, and they raised two sons.

Donald ""Don"" MD.<br/><br/> President Emeritus of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, died February 24, 2015 at the age of 77. The cause of his death was a brain tumor, his wife said. He was born July 20, 1937 in Burlington, VT to Italian immigrants. He spent his youth in Barre, VT and went on to the University of Vermont in Burlington, earning a B.S. in 1959 and graduating from the UVM Medical School summa cum laude in 1963. His internship years were spent at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. His research career, which he began in Vermont with Dr. Thomas Tomasi, continued at the National Institutes of Health with Dr. Alan Peterkofsky. In 1967 he returned to NYC for a two year guest investigatorship with Dr. Henry Kunkel at the Rockefeller University. He then joined the first faculty of Mt. Sinai Medical School and continued there until 1974. At that time he joined the University of Texas Health Science Center in Dallas, TX as a full professor and then proceeded to do some of his most important work in antibody research, laying the foundation for the field of monoclonal antibody therapy in a number of human diseases. At age 60 he was asked to be the president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in Oklahoma City, OK, a non-profit medical research institution. He felt that this was the challenge of his lifetime, and during his nine year tenure he doubled the size of the institute and increased its NIH funding from $8 million to $27 million. For the last eight years of his life he consulted for universities and large and small pharmaceutical firms. In 1958 Don married Patricia Hollister, and they raised two sons. He was predeceased by his parents Mary DeMaio Capra and Richard Capra. He is survived by his wife of 57 years, his son Jay Capra, MD and wife Nancy of Abilene, TX, his son Tony Capra of Carrollton, TX, his grandson Donald Capra and wife Sally of Amarillo, TX, granddaughter Sarah Seltzer and husband Will and great-step grandson Cooper Seltzer of Fort Worth, TX, and by granddaughter Twig Capra of New York City. He is also survived by his sister Carolyn Sanderson of Sagamore, MA and his nieces Lisa Morgera of Shrewsbury, MA and Kathy Riedinger of Double Oak, TX. Don's research career was prodigious. He was Principal Investigator on 72 NIH grants and had 375 scientific publications, including chapters and books. He was a founding member and past president of the Henry Kunkel Society, was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Association of American Physicians, and of the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and served as an officer for the American Association of Immunologists. His love of science and teaching was only surpassed by his love of family and the Dallas Cowboys. A Celebration of Don's life will be held March 21, 2015 at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation at 2:00pm. All are welcome. A second celebration will be in Barre, VT at a time to be announced in late spring, where Don's ashes will be interred in Hope Cemetery. The family respectfully requests no flowers, but that donations be made to the Drs. Patricia H. & J. Donald Capra Scholarship Fund of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, or to the educational institute of your choice.<br><br>

She was beloved by faculty, students and patients. She retired in her late 80's after a courageous and successful fight against cancer and heart disease. Evelyn was among the founders of Women Strike for Peace, active in the antiwar movement, the League of Women Voters, the Urban League, as well as a proud and early member of the NAACP and a long-time supporter of the Southern Poverty Law Center. In Chicago she organized and began the first tot lots in Hyde Park, started and volunteered in the after school programs at the Hyde Park Study Center, and worked with teen mothers on the west side of Chicago at the Parent/Child Center. She was a long-time subscriber to many Chicago theater companies, Chicago and New York museums and other cultural venues. She was known for her sharp mind her children believed she forgot almost nothing. Playful and known for her edgy sense of humor, she loved to entertain and travel, was enormously engaging, and energetic. Always generous and caring, she welcomed many visitors of all ages and backgrounds to her home throughout her life. With her husband, she supported the work of writers, teachers, and visual artists establishing a number of prizes in New York and Chicago, and considered herself a passionate lover of all art forms, in particular dance, theater, music. She lived most of her adult life in Chicago's Hyde Park, a stalwart defender of integration and equal access to opportunities for all races and creeds; she set a strong example in resisting the white flight from the inner city to suburbia. In the last years of her life she returned to New York City as a resident of the Upper West Side where she kindled new friendships and maintained a cultural schedule that would challenge people decades younger and in better health. Her intellect, interest in others, will to live and generosity of spirit were intact to the very end. A resilient fighter, she tackled a number of very difficult health challenges and battled them all with fierceness and a tenacity to wring all she could from her time in this world. Evelyn and Stan were married 72 years. He survives her. Together, they raised three children and shared many adventures. She wished to be remembered as a loving wife, proud mother, loyal and good friend and an activist. Evelyn was an extraordinary woman whose like we will not see again.

Lee was drafted into the Army in October 1941 and became a commissioned officer. He was sent to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to study radar. His work served to improve a pilots ability to avoid enemy fire, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star. After the war, he met Dorothy, who was to be his life long companion.

Lee learned the electricians trade and became an electrical contractor, while Dorothy pursued a Masters in Social Work.

Lee became a Bay Area leader in developing opportunities for minority contractors in the construction industry. Lee was the first President of the Jewish Community Center East Bay in the early 1980s and he and Dorothy have continued their support of the JCC East Bay since that time. Active in civic affairs, Lee served on the Berkeley Waterfront and Berkeley Planning City Commissions. An avid tennis player and lover of opera and literature, Lee stayed in good health well into his 90s. Moderation in all things, including moderation"" he would say.
