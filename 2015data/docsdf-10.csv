336,,2015-05-25,article,"Paid Notice: Deaths  LEAF, MARTIN N",556d1c677988103a0e6f2eaa,Classified,"LEAF--Martin N. A practicing attorney in New York since 1958, Martin N. Leaf died in Manhattan on May 23 after a long illness. In his legal career he created successful joint ventures and business relationships among major companies throughout the world. He managed litigation, handled dispute resolution, conducted complex contract negotiations, and focused on First Amendment and intellectual property rights cases. Leaf obtained his first legal post--a clerkship while still in law school--when the criminal defense lawyer Emile Zola Berman delivered a lecture to 250 law students. When Berman asked if there were any questions, Leaf raised his hand and asked, ""Can I have a job in your office?"" Berman told him to be at his office the next Monday afternoon--and he got the position. His next clerkship led to a position with Fuchsberg & Fuchsberg, with whom he worked for five years, trying dozens of cases in jury trials. At one point, the young lawyer had earned a record of 20-0. In 1963 Leaf formed the firm of Leaf, Kurzman and Deull together with two other attorneys, Robert G. Kurzman and Ellis M. Deull, and practiced with them for sixteen years, after which he joined the litigation department of Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein. Notwithstanding his official retirement in 1990, Leaf continued his relationship with several long-time clients and worked every day since then. In his theatrical practice he represented several entertainment figures, including the actors Raul Julia and Anthony Zerbe, the singer John Denver, and the stage designer Chester Weinberg. Along with his interest in humanitarian projects, he worked with The Hunger Project, an international charity to eliminate hunger across the globe, as a United Nations NGO (non- governmental organization). And he has served as litigation counsel for Landmark, an international development and training company. As counsel for Takachiho Koheki in 1970, he negotiated a ground-breaking joint venture with the computer manufacturer Burroughs Corporation (now Unisys), which became a template for U.S.-Japanese business ventures. Leaf was active in his hometown of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York and served as the Village Attorney for fourteen years through successive political administrations, and also served as Special District Attorney for Westchester County. In 1965, along with his wife, Louise Sarkin Leaf, and five other couples, he co- founded Temple Beth Shalom in Hastings, which now has more than 400 members. While representing Lhamo Dondrub, the 14th Dalai Lama, Leaf got the U.S. State Department to reverse its previous ruling and to issue a visa to let the Dalai Lama come to the United States. He helped the Dalai Lama to add two new chapters to the original plate of his early book, My Land and My People. During the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Leaf served as a ""Goodwill Ambassador"" to Denmark through the ""People to People"" program in which U.S. families exchanged visits with their Danish counterparts. Leaf served on the boards of numerous companies, as well as many nonprofit organizations, including the American Arab Council (consisting of retired ambassadors, ministers of state in the Arab world, and other dignitaries); Trail Blazers Camp (camping for inner city children, founded 1887); Windstar (John Denver's nonprofit organization, focused on the environment and sustainability); the Buckminster Fuller Institute, the National Black Theater; Pro Musicis, a 50-year-old organization supporting musical talent in young people and in residents of institutions where great music is not available (such as prisons, mental health facilities, hospitals, and drug rehabilitation centers); and Echo Hills Mental Health Clinic (a facility for Westchester residents). As a delegate for five years to the NGO Branch of the United Nations, he submitted a White Paper on World Hunger. Leaf was born in New York City, February 19, 1932. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, and received his law degree from The New York University School of Law. He served with distinction in the U.S. Army, attaining the rank of Second Lieutenant. He was married for almost forty years to Louise Sarkin Leaf, an urban planner in New Rochelle, until her death in 1995. His children are Marc Leaf, an attorney in New York; Jenifer Leaf Jaeger, a physician now working for the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and Cliff Leaf, an author and magazine editor. He loved his grandchildren (in alphabetical order, Connie, Emma, John, Lauren, Rachel, Sam, Sofia, and William) and greatgrandchildren Hadley, Lulu, and Sophie. He was born ""with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad,"" and died surrounded by those he loved and who loved him most, his children, his ""everything,"" Norma Deull, and their extended families.

Leaf served on the boards of numerous companies, as well as many nonprofit organizations, including the American Arab Council (consisting of retired ambassadors, ministers of state in the Arab world, and other dignitaries); Trail Blazers Camp (camping for inner city children, founded 1887); Windstar (John Denver's nonprofit organization, focused on the environment and sustainability); the Buckminster Fuller Institute, the National Black Theater; Pro Musicis, a 50-year-old organization supporting musical talent in young people and in residents of institutions where great music is not available (such as prisons, mental health facilities, hospitals, and drug rehabilitation centers); and Echo Hills Mental Health Clinic (a facility for Westchester residents). As a delegate for five years to the NGO Branch of the United Nations, he submitted a White Paper on World Hunger. Leaf was born in New York City, February 19, 1932. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, and received his law degree from The New York University School of Law. He served with distinction in the U.S. Army, attaining the rank of First Lieutenant. He was married for almost forty years to Louise Sarkin Leaf, an urban planner in New Rochelle, until her death in 1995. His children are Marc Leaf, an attorney in New York; Jenifer Leaf Jaeger, a physician now working for the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and Cliff Leaf, an author and magazine editor. He loved his grandchildren (in alphabetical order, Connie, Emma, John, Lauren, Rachel, Sam, Sofia, and William) and greatgrandchildren Hadley, Lulu, and Sophie. He was born ""with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad,"" and died surrounded by those he loved and who loved him most, his children, his ""everything,"" Norma Deull, and their extended families. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, May 27, 2015, at 10:00am, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Hunger Project or Citymeals-on-Wheels.<br/><br/><br><br>

Loving husband of Joan, brother of Paula Oreck, father of Susan (Jonathan Bram) and Elizabeth (Andrew Cohen) and adoring grandfather of Nathan, Lily, Henry, Julia and Jenny. Arthur was a proud 1949 graduate of The Fieldston School, was surely its longest serving trustee, and maintained cherished lifelong friendships with many of his classmates. Both of his daughters and all five grandchildren continued his legacy there. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1953, where he was a long serving trustee and permanent class president. As was his way, he made many wonderful friends at Hopkins, through whom he ultimately met his bride, Joannie Goldberg of Charleston, SC, a Goucher graduate. From 1954-57, he served in the United States Army Security Agency in Tokyo and was awarded the Commendation Ribbon for Meritorious Achievement. Arthur was the president of Bruno Appliance Corporation, a distribution business started by his father, Irving, which was for many years the country's largest distributor of RCA and Whirlpool appliances. Arthur was a trustee of Beth Israel Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners for many decades. Arthur loved tradition and often joked that he was never one for change, choosing to spend 80 of his 84 years in the same Central Park West apartment. He was president of the Kenilworth's co-op board for many years. Throughout his illness, the dinners he shared with a group of special neighbors were true highlights. Arthur was the youngest child in a large extended family and his pride in his uncle General David Sarnoff's accomplishments was well known. He was thrilled to preside over the enormous and wonderful Sarnoff family Thanksgiving at his home in Yorktown Heights for many years. Arthur also truly embraced Joan's colorful southern family and was in turn embraced by the Dumas clan. In 1978 the couple purchased a home on South Carolina's Sullivan's Island and spent happy summers on the beach surrounded by multiple generations. The annual Shabbat dinners they hosted there were loud and delicious and are cherished memories of their loving extended family. Family legend maintains that Arthur was the first season ticket holder at the new Madison Square Garden, cheering the Knicks to their two championships with an enthusiasm he would later bring to his grandchildren's endless parade of sports games, concerts and the Fieldston fashion show. Arthur was kind and generous to so many people who passed through his life, maintaining meaningful relationships with classmates, neighbors, distant cousins, old army buddies and many of his children's friends and classmates.

738,,2015-05-24,article,"Paid Notice: Deaths  TORSON, JOHN",556bcb6779881019f18de4fc,Classified,"TORSON--John. John Archie Torson, private art dealer and resident of New York City for more than 60 years, died Thursday evening, May 14, 2015, from an accident while still in good health, which is what he had always hoped, and not far from the apartment he called home for most of his life. Just short of 90 years of age, John remained active and engaging. He was looking forward with great anticipation to the soon arrival of his family for what he said would be our last get- together. So although his family grieves that he is gone, we take solace that he died while in a happy state and still out and about in the city he so loved. He has been a loyal and contented resident of Manhattan and thought it, indeed, knew it to be the greatest city in the world. John was born in Independence, Wisconsin in 1926. He grew up in this small, rural farming village with his parents and sister. Independence always held a cherished place in his heart, but in his senior year of high school, he was called into the US Navy during war times. After serving until 1947, he then attended the University of Minnesota where he studied art and architecture. Graduating in 1952, he began work in Minneapolis at the Dayton Company. In 1954, he moved to New York City. Once there he was first associated with the Wayah Gallery on 4th Avenue. Encouraged by Mr. Wayah and with the confidence and the initial financial backing of his parents, John ventured out into what would become his profession and went to Europe in 1956 for his first art buying trip. His chosen profession proved ideal for his temperament and critical eye. He never stopped working, loving art, and enjoying people from all over the world who shared his enthusiasm for the arts and the artist behind the creative enterprise. John was a world traveller and always keenly aware of his surroundings and the beauty that a discerning eye could discover. He became schooled in art, music, and architecture without ever losing his love and passion for these artistic forms. He was well known and respected by his peers and clients within the art community. He also supported many fine museums, galleries, and institutions of art and music, especially those in his beloved city, notably The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, The Morgan Library, The Frick, The Mannes School of Music, and The Julliard School of Music. We know there are many more that should be mentioned. He had friends from all over the world, and all who knew him would agree that our world has lost a very keen eye and provocative mind. John had the unique proclivity of becoming important to the many people whose lives he touched. Primarily because he sought to appreciate each persons's individuality, while at the same time probing to understand, he became significant to each of us. He guarded zealously his own freedom of mind and because of this, chose to remain somewhat anonymous and always independent. He loved children and treasured the pictures made for him by those of a dear friend when he was in the hospital five years ago recovering from a traumatic brain injury. He wanted to be alive in this world only as long as he remained vital. He was never self indulgent, but he certainly enjoyed good food at the places that he frequented. He was a man of routines. And he had many special friends with whom he engaged regularly for meals and events and social occasions. He was friendly, warm, generous, charming, clever, funny, and witty and became special even to strangers, if given a chance to interact. John had to be shared among many people, but he didn't mind. Smile. One friend once said of him, he makes more use of New York City for what it has to offer in the arts than any other person I know. That could also be said of his ability to challenge each of us to see differently and think more deeply. Being a successful art dealer, he also contributed to the financial success of others. But more than anything, he wanted each of us to enter into the visual world he experienced. The art world has lost a great ally, and we have lost a good friend. He will be missed. He is survived by his beloved sister, Patricia (Boyd), and her children whom he adopted as his own -- his nieces, Carol and Cathy, and his nephews, William and Matthew. John opened his home to his extended family and never tired of showing them New York's greatness, as well as its not so easily discovered treasures. We were all blessed to have known him. Family and close friends will gather to celebrate his life in the city he cherished and then return his ashes to Wisconsin to be buried beside his father Archie and his mother Caroline. In lieu of flowers, he can be remembered by a gift in his name to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1/3",Paid Death Notices,,"Paid Notice: Deaths  TORSON, JOHN TORSON--John.
